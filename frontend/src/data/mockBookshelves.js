          "comment": "I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!",

It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular.",

          "comment": "Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, \"You are all liars!\"3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. \"Too much concentration can be worse than none at all\" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The \"I did not know\" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the \"I.\"5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, \"Frees slaves,\" and then \"Call anytime\" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the \"I,\" the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, \"God was in this place and I did not know it was i.\" We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent.",

Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.",

      "rate": "3.1/5",
      "description": "\"I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary.\" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, \"Is there another way to lead a good life?\" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts \"spoke directly to me,\" writes Bender. Somehow, \"they went straight to my heart.\" Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen \"glows\" and \"no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday.\" In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her \"crazy-quilt\" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive \"patches\" of her own life. Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, Plain and Simple speaks to the seeker in each of us.",

It's an introspective book that begins in 1967, although the actual 'journey' doesn't come about until 1982. Women shape society, and society shapes women. If all women were as modest as the Amish, we would never have achieved the right to vote. It takes all kinds to make a world.In terms of pages, the book is less than a half inch thick, so the journey is a 'light read'. Amish history can be found on the internet with ease.It's always amusing to me when people grab a book in haste, find it's not their cuppa tea, and then blame the author entirely for wasting their money. For that mindset, I recommend the public library.This is a mid-life soul-searching little book about One Woman's experience at One point in time. The author makes the point that American society is neither plain nor simple for most of us, and reveals how trying to strike a balance between serenity and ambitious pursuits is never easy. Most of us can't even write a Christmas newsletter that anyone else wants to read, but we're sure qualified to pass harsh judgement on another person's honest little journal.Personally, I found this a nice little book for a winter's night.",

It certainly gives believers, in this day, a hearty look at what believers went through, the persecution and martyrdom, that was brutally dispensed back then. It was very interesting to hear the dying words of unbelievers; what widespread sorrow and hopelessness existed in their final moments.I'm a fan of history and I can tell you that some of the dates that are cited by Lockyer are way off. For example, it mentions the war with Britain in 1842 (it was 1812) and U.S. president James Buchanan taking office in 1860 (off by a few years). Since these were so obvious I'm sure that other inaccurracies exist elsewhere in the book. I certainly would take care in verifying the information first, before quoting it in public.A special note: There's definitely an anti-Rome bias that would make it tough for some people to get through this book. Although Lockyer mentions Protestant attrocities, he reserves extra criticism for Roman Catholic ones. It's this lack of objectivity that prevents this work from being a great book, just a good one.",

This sickness he sees as having also invaded traditional Judaism.He strives to understand how Judaism can provide meaning in a variety of areas of life, including in sexual ethics, in the place of the woman in society,in the state of Israel. He argues that there needs to be a new Jewish revival of spirit. He says that this should involve a Jewish movement toward combining religious and secular learning. He says that the Jewish world must find its meaning in greater unity, greater mutual caring and concern. He concludes the work as follows:\"Contemplating the dangers besetting all Israel, the threats to our very survival- not at all unlike those in the days of Nazism-how can we think of facing the challenges of the hour without the strongest possible unity of all Israel, without the highest grade of responsibility toward Klal Yisrael, without being carried forward by the deepest sense of Ahavat Yisrael? How can we do it without realizing that Bein kakh uvein kakh , either way, such are the Jews God has still left; that either way, they are the only brothers and sisters still left us, upon whom alone we may count and who count on us!\"Rabbi Berkovits wrote these words nearly thirty years ago at the time of the Yom Kippur War. They of course apply today when Israel and the Jewish people are encountering a new evil combination of anti- Semitism from extreme left and Islamic fundamentalist right.This is a book that speaks to the Jewish crisis even today.",

He addresses the disintegration of traditional values and the search for meaning in areas like sexual ethics and societal roles. Berkovits stresses the importance of combining religious and secular learning for a meaningful Jewish existence. His message, penned during the Yom Kippur War, remains relevant amidst contemporary challenges of anti-Semitism. This book resonates with readers facing the ongoing Jewish crisis, advocating for unity and responsibility towards Klal Yisrael."

I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses. Especially in the beginning of he book, it was almost as though he trotted out every one that he knew just because he knew it. Cussing is like hot sauce -- a little goes a long way.",

Maar hoe kan de moordenaar op twee plekken tegelijk zijn? Onnatuurlijke dood is het achtste boek uit de bloedstollende bestsellerserie rond patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta van auteur Patricia Cornwell. Deze serie, bestaande uit meer dan 20 bloedstollende crimethrillers, betekende Patricia Cornwells doorbraak als grondlegger van de pathologisch-anatomische thriller. Negen gruwelijk verminkte lijken zijn er al gevonden: vijf in Ierland en vier in Amerika. Steeds wordt het lichaam gedumpt op een vuilnisbelt en steeds worden de ledematen afgesneden. Wie pleegt deze verschrikkelijke moorden? Wanneer een tiende lijk wordt gevonden, wordt patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta opgeroepen om de zaak te onderzoeken. Alles lijkt erop dat een en dezelfde dader aan het werk is, maar is er echt sprake van dezelfde dader? Kay Scarpetta en rechercheur Pete Marino ontdekken steeds meer bewijsmateriaal dat wijst op een alomvattend complot, waardoor het gehele land in gevaar is... Patricia Cornwells werk over de vrouwelijke patholoog-anatoom Scarpetta is de bestverkochte thrillerserie ter wereld; alleen in Nederland en Vlaanderen zijn er al 1,5 miljoen exemplaren verkocht. Ook werd de serie bekroond met de Edgar Award en de Gold Dagger.",

My favourites being the claustrophobic &quot;The Body Farm&quot;, and the superbly dark &quot;Point of Origin&quot;. I have loved all the Scarpetta's, and read them at least twice over, and i still think this is the worst.The plot was very complicated, and it all seemed a bit of a mess. The characters were nothing special, and i this is the only book in which Cornwell manage to bore me with her normally insightful computer terminology. It's too long, and basically i dont think it has any substance. There is a great potential. The idea for the plot is superb, and could well have been one of the best, but somewhere along the line it all slips. I cant put my finger on it, but i just didnt come away from this with the satisfaction i normally get out of a Kay Scarpetta book.Nevertheless this is still a necessary book to read if you intend to read the entire series. It is one of the major turning points. The first book to feature Temple Gault, who would later lead to Carrie Grethen, Newton Joyce, and all the other catastrophic events which culminate in the next turning point of &quot;The Last Precint&quot;. each one has signalled a new era for Patricia Cornwell, and each one has not been quite as good as the others. But The Last Precint was still much better than this. It is, admittedly, very clever, but far too complicated, and im surprised it got the CWA's gold dagger.nevertheless, i have given it two stars purely because it is such a major point in Scarpetta's life. You must read it if you intend to read the entire series, but dont expect to enjoy it as much as you do the others.",

At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can't help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn't seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration. Overall, Cruel and Unusual works as a crime novel, but still leaves the reader somewhat dissatisfied at the end.",

      "description": "The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

Images of previous murder victims propped up in poses flash though Kay Scarpetta's mind and she knows immediately that this murder seems to be the handy work of Temple Gault. The body count doesn't end there though as Gault leaves a trail of violence and death. Gault is getting careless and this might mean he will finally slip up enough to be caught. There are a lot of twist and turns in this book that will leave you flipping to just one more page and then another pausing just long enough to get up and make sure that your doors are locked.I have read too many horror novels to count. I've never been scared by any book except for Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. I read right before I go to sleep and there have been nights that I slept with one eye open after reading one of her books. I recommend that you read the series in order to fully understand and enjoy the books.",

However, the plot was so good and the action was pretty tense, so I was willing to overlook those details.I was honestly enjoying the book. Then I came to the ending. I had read the Scarpetta series in order from Postmortem to this one. Her serial killer Gault appears in several of the prior books, and the Scarpetta vs. Gualt finale happens here. I won't give it away, but let me say I was so disappointed that I quit reading the series.The poor ending of this book, combined with the unrealistic events and general lack of research by the author in all her books has made me decide not to read anymore from Cornwell. With books I haven't read by better authors like DeMille, Deaver, Connelly, and Crais I don't want to waste my time with below average books.",

Temple Gault has been murdering people for many years. He hasn't struck for a while, and everyone, including Kay Scarpetta, dreads the horrid day when he does. Kay Scarpetta is the chief medical examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI.When they find this unidentified body, they know immedidately that it is a Gault killing......for only he murders and them puts the victim in a sitting position. This time Kay and her team are determined to find and kill Gault, no matter what the cost. But this time is different, Gault seems to be chasing Kay and her computer expert niece Lucy. Lucy, however, tries to beat him at his own game. She tries to trap him on the computer long enough so that they can find out where Gault is located.From Potter's Field, by, Patricia Cornwell, starts out pretty slow, but soon reaches the action part and takes off from there. It is a very well written, chilling and suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat.I really enjoyed this book not only because it was well written, but because it was a mystery.

          "comment": "Does anybody really believe that when a joint FBI/police/medical examiner team needs to locate West Coast dental specialists quickly, they would decide the best way is TO SPAM EVERY USER ON PRODIGY asking for a knowledgable dentist to contact them?This book has so many problems, I hardly know where to start. They fall into two main areas -- no, not the print and the page, the pages, at least, are innocent! There are editorial problems, and problems inherent in a story that reads as if it didn't have the author's full attention.Let's begin with the editorial problems. Do you believe that sirens can &quot;whelp&quot; through the sky? (and is that why we say it's raining cats and dogs? or at least, puppies?)Dialogue moves in and out of a &quot;no contractions&quot; zone, which has the characters suddenly using formal diction -- maybe ONE character in modern America could get away with this, but most of them? How often do senior cops and med. examiners, in casual conversation, say &quot;I will not&quot; and &quot;I do not&quot; instead of &quot;I won't&quot; or &quot;I don't&quot;? It's the unevenness that is jolting and extremely irritating, as if there were multiple editors, one of whom didn't believe in contractions while the others did.But the editors can't be blamed for the plot problems and general stupidity of the characters. How many times are we expected to believe that people who are told every other sentence that they should not go out alone have yet again gone out alone? One second they're talking about putting Scarpetta into the Federal Witness Protection scheme and the next, she's going into work 2 hours early so she'll have the whole building to yourself -- does anybody think the readers will be surprised when You Know Who intrudes on Scarpetta's early-morning solitude? It happens repeatedly. It's like a B-grade horror movie -- the characters are idiots who walk stupidly into danger they could easily avoid. But then there'd be no book (not necessarily a bad thing).The main character's resemblance to Superman pales quickly. In a crime scene, only Scarpetta will spot the incriminating footprint. In a crowd scene, only Scarpetta will spot the suspect in the crowd. Why bother with all the other police/FBI/NY Transit Police?Even so, Scarpetta doesn't detect much, she mostly intuits. If more than one person could have done something, you can bet that Scarpetta knows which one did it. How? She just knows. Maybe the rest of the team doesn't know whether the killer is in Virginia or NY, but Scarpetta does. Why? She just knows. If one character has a high-ranking uncle, and she hears that another is vaguely rumored to be related to someone important, you can bet that she'll guess the two are siblings, and she'll be right, and the reader will not get any more explanation. As a reader, I feel cheated -- where is the detection? If I wanted to read about clairvoyance, I'd be reading books in a different genre.The ONE redeeming feature is the scene in which Scarpetta meets the parents of the serial killer. That jumps off the page. What is it like to have your child turn out to be a monster? How would you react? Cornwell should have developed this, made it the focus of the book, have Scarpetta skillfully tease useful information from the parents, DO SOME DETECTION, instead of having her charging around with an arsenal, hopping planes and FBI 'copters all over the East Coast until you, the reader, feel the jet lag.If Cornwell can write that scene, why did she write 400 pages of drivel to wrap around it? I know that she's a well-known, well-respected author, but she was really asleep at the wheel for this one.I only wish Amazon would let you give a book ZERO stars.",

Otherwise as sf, striking for the number of ideas that later appeared more fully developed by Larry Niven: the Body Banks, stocked by political prisoners to supply organ transplants for the general populace; the eponymous Reefs resemble the Smoke Ring as environments where humans live in free fall; Starchild :: \"Passerby\"; and even a bit of wirehead foreshadowing, though it goes in a different, more religious, direction.The first volume by itself is interesting enough to rate three stars, as long as you're tolerant of the future tech of fifty years ago; later volumes get worse, to only one for Rogue Star--the writing just goes too far downhill, becoming stereotyped Bad 60s SF",

On author Philip José Farmer’s Riverworld, humans from every era and culture have been simultaneously resurrected. Ancient Hebrews, medieval warriors, Spanish Inquisitors, and modern Americans intermingle in this strange new environment, but many still cling to old prejudices. Tom Mix, a silent-film star originally from early-twentieth-century Earth, is journeying among the vast population along the millions of miles of the River, in search of familiar faces from his own time. He’s been traveling the River for five years and believes people are starting to change. But when he’s entangled in a brutal clash between states, he discovers that some are slow to let go of the ideas that ruled them on Earth. This volume includes the novelette “Riverworld,” along with two additional Riverworld tales and ten other short stories, all strange, clever, and profound. Farmer’s explorations of the wonderful and bizarre—from a portrayal of Jesus and Satan as cowpokes to a reimagining of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan in the style of William Burroughs—plunge the reader into “one of the most imaginative worlds in science fiction” (Booklist).

C. on the Dude Ranch,” “The Volcano,” “The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol,” “The Problem of Sore Bridge—Among Others,” “Brass and Gold (or Horse and Zeppelin in Beverly Hills),” “The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod,” “The Voice of the Sonar in My Vermiform Appendix,” “Monolog,” “The Leaser of Two Evils,” “The Phantom of the Sewers,” “Up the Bright River,” “Crossing the Dark River,” and Philip JosFarmer’s article on the making of Riverworld, “The Source of the River.”",

          "comment": "I like Philip Jose Farmer's works, or at least I thought I did until I read Riverworld and Other Stories. I devoured Dark Is the Sun when I was in junior high, and read the Riverworld series a half dozen times in high school. As an adult, I was amused by A Barnstormer in Oz. So, when I saw Riverworld and Other Stories at a book fair I picked it up, figuring the price (25 cents) was right.Let's start with the non-Riverworld stories first. Several of them are . . . well, there's no other word for it besides obscene. Farmer himself tells us that one of the stories would only published by a hard-porn magazine, and one can see why. These stories must be what the Supreme Court means when they mention \"the prurient interest.\" They're not erotic, just vulgar. And yet, as literary exercises they contain a certain amount of morbid fascination. \"The Leaser of Two Evils\" and \"The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol\" in particular show Farmer's remarkable ability to lose himself in a character's dementia. But is the cleverness worth the obscenity? One can't help but think that such pieces as \"J.C. on the Dude Ranch\" (I'd describe it, but I can't) are better left in Farmer's desk drawer never to see the light of day.There are some pedestrian stories, too, including the amusing but uninspiring \"The Problem of the Sore Bridge\" which almost features a Sherlock Holmes cameo. It's the image of Henry Miller on the prowl in a nursing home that lingers in the memory, though, not the pedestrian stories.As for \"Riverworld\" itself, the story is not, as the packaging suggests, the first Riverworld story Farmer wrote. His own introduction makes it clear that he wrote the stories that became \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\" first. Nevertheless, \"Riverworld\" is an appropriate foray into the Riverworld. Tom Mix, a character I never cared for in the novels, is much more appealing here. Most provocative, however, is Farmer's take on Jesus - who finds himself resurrected along the river bank with everyone else. Farmer's \"Yeshua\" is a pacifist in the face of senseless violence, a man struggling to maintain serenity when his life's belief has turned out to, perhaps, be false. There was a reference Jesus in Gods of Riverworld; this story fleshes it out. To my surprise, part of me was offended by Farmer's take on Jesus; yet Yeshua should serve to spark healthy discussion over the nature of Jesus, what he really stood for, and what he would make of the way his teachings have been passed down by Paul and two thousand years. Such spiritual examinations are, in my view, nearly always healthy.\"Riverworld\" alone makes this collection worth getting and keeping. As for the other stories . . . . I really don't know. Perhaps if one knows going in that one is going to get X-rated material it would be easier to digest. Perhaps not. Either way, except for \"Riverworld\", none of these are stories that one would ever want to read a second time.",

It's a departure of sorts from Ms. Pilcher's typical sagas, in that there is a bit of a mystery involved. I LOVE a great mystery!The story begins in London with Laura, married for only six months to Alec, finding she must have immediate surgery and therefore ruining their plans for a vacation to Scotland with a group of her husband's oldest friends. She, INSISTS that Alec go on his annual fishing trip without her which he is reluctant to do; however, only if she will agree to recuperate at the home of his Uncle and Aunt on the coast of Cornwall will he even consider this trip without her. This may seem a bit harsh, but Laura is adament.Insecure Laura, being about fifteen years younger than her new husband, is filled with angst about his first marriage and the friends that knew his first wife. She's also concerned about his mysterious teenaged daughter whom she's not yet met and Alec never mentions.During her stay, Laura begins thinking about her life and all of the feelings that have been bothering her. The relaxing recovery starts to change when a jealous neighbor goes on a plot to ruin Laura's life. The horrible sequence of events are kept secret from Laura, however there are several unhappy moments for her that makes her grow into a stronger individual.As if she doesn't have enough to contend with, Laura is surprised by a visit from her never-before-seen stepdaughter who has her own problem to share with Laura.Rosamunde Pilcher has a wonderful way of writing interesting stories about families; (sometimes) weak women that turn their lives around and become strong.This was usual for Ms. Pilcher in the lovely descriptions; what I really enjoyed was the \"who-done-it\"!",

After a hundred pages, however, I felt a sinking sensation as I realized that this story could not possibly have a happy ending. Bell had done such an excellent job realizing his characters that I felt deeply involved in their lives. After the horrendous atrocities of slavery and the slave revolts and subsequent battles, it seemed that the island was finally at some sort of peace.But what a price! Then as the French arrived to re-assert their primacy and General Louveture succumbs to hubris the precarious peace falls apart and the bloodshed begins again with blacks against whites.This last book completes the trilogy and tells a story that few of us know anything about. Haiti is a huge mystery to me and these books helped me understand a little why this country is the way it is.

Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future. In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock 'n' roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights. Watson's characters are brought vividly to life through Travis's touching, powerful and intensely personal voice. A dark and evocative coming of age tale, Sweet Dream Baby begins steeped in innocence and ends in a dramatically different place. \"I can't remember a book that sneaked up and grabbed me the way Sweet Dream Baby did.

This is not surprising in a world of readers who can't read more than the words, for the vast majority of readers feel a sympathy with and automatically believe a First-Person Narrator, when in actuality, used to its fullest, it tells a story that (s)he thinks is one thing and the perceptive reader sees is an entirely differenct story. One reviewer said it has a surprise ending; another, a predictably melodramatic conclusion.I shall forgo rebutting other comments such as the secondary characters being stock, that the setting is the familiar stew of small town intrigue and Southern Gothic, and that it breaks no new ground, for these are more of the shallow readings endemic to our state of letters these days.What is important about this book is that it reveals the nature of the story-teller-narrator who unwittingly tells a story that is much more than he thinks it is.Some people will wonder why present tense is used. The answer is relatively simple: It avoids the problems of Why is this person telling me the reader this story now? and Who am I supposed to be? and How can a First-Person Narrator remember all of the action proper and especially every word that every person spoke? Present tense is the natural tense if we are to be privy to a story as it and the mind that tells it evolve.The story and its resolution are set up on the first page, and anyone who goes back and rereads it after finishing the book and who notices during the reading that the child uses almost no subordinate clauses, will see what a well-wrought work of craft and vision SWEET DREAM BABY is. My only compaint is that the title appears to have been changed by the publisher. Mr. Watson surely knows better than to let an editor mess with the spine of a story. And I don't believe for a second that Mr. Watson doesn't know what his story is about. A much more apt title would have been THINGS LOST, for that indicates the controlling image and contains the essence of what the story is truly about.",

But ‘wet work’—the shooting of a victim from up close—is only half the story and the further up the chain Charley gets, the higher the stakes become. To nail Peru’s megalomaniac cocaine king, he will have to hire himself some hit men, a gunboat and some truly extraordinary weaponry . . .",

          "comment": "Let me start by saying this book is a classic for any zombie fan but I have always been a George Romero fan and these zombies were not what I expected.In this book there is different stages of dead if that makes sense. Some of the dead in this book can drive cars and function almost normally, but others are less intelligent and have hard times doing basic tasks. The whole scenario of a comet passing over and killing the immune system of the living and bringing the dead back to life was really cool but it wasn't totally original. Watch the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET and you will know what I am talking about. The book was a little short and very bleak at the end. It leaves no hope for humanities survival, but a great book all in all. I recommend this book highly but only 4 out of 5 to me.",

I read the book that same week and I must say that I was very happy about my impulse buy. Mr. Nutman paints a very vivid picture of the end of the world and I would like to say to those out there who condemn the splatterpunk genre, that they should read this story before making a fool of themselves furthur. Richly descriptive and horrifying, this is what horror fiction is all about. Its like a nightmare written on page with all the claustrophobia and despair of a zombie invasion present. I have to make a personal confession. I rarely remember my dreams, but I sometimes do when they are nightmares. My worst nightmares have been about the living dead taking over the world and consuming the living. Its like Mr. Nutman took the anarchy, terror, and hopelessness of one of these dreams and made it his own. The characters are well structured, the pace of the tale furious, the story well realised. The only drawback: too damn short! I can only imagine what an epic length would have brought forth, such as the scale of the Stand or Swan Song. Mr. Nutman, do me a favor. Write more more more!",

I remember being torn between boredom and paying an overpriced amount for this novel at the airport book store. In the end, my need to satisfy my appetite for zombie apocalypse won over.I knew it would be a good buy, though, primarily because I was already familiar with the short story version of Wet Work by Philip Nutman when he wrote for Skipp and Spector's \"The Book of the Dead\" anthology (an AMAZING zombie anthology and one of the first of it's kind). So, the title and author's name alone had immediately caught my eye.Upon realising that Nutman had expanded it into a full sized novel, it wasn't long before I became easily convinced to go ahead and splurge. Was definitely worth it because i've read the novel a few times over since then.It is certainly a quick and easy read and worth tracking down for sure, which i have had to myself since my dog ate my original '93 copy.The story wasn't perfect and doesn't stick to normal zombie apocalypse protocol, but it was memorable and original.So, take this particular zombie story lightly; it takes place in the course of presidency under George H. W. Bush, involves government cover-ups, black ops, there are thinking zombies, some dark comedy, some corny phrases and a shoddily written sex scene that I read with a grain of salt. But, if you can be forgiving, you just may enjoy the creativeness and perspectives in this zombie tale.Keep in mind I give five stars for being innovative at the time of it's debut as much as I do for the nostalgia of when I first read it.If you like zombie adventure, covert operations, plot twists and zombies that retain function and intelligence, check this out.",

      "summary_ai": "The novel is praised for its unique take on zombies, vivid descriptions, and horror elements, with some reviewers comparing it to nightmares and appreciating its creativity. However, some find the book too short and note deviations from traditional zombie lore. The storyline involves a comet causing chaos and societal collapse, with intelligent zombies, government cover-ups, and dark humor. Despite mixed opinions on adherence to zombie genre norms, the book is recommended for its innovation and nostalgic value, particularly for fans of zombie adventures and unconventional storytelling."

Breanna, the main character, isn't a native of Xanth but instead migrated with the Black Wave; human migration into Xanth has always happened in waves of people. And so the readers see Xanth through Breanna's eyes, which is a great way to see it if you're new to the series.Not overfull of puns, as some of the later Xanth books are, \"Zombie Lover\" follows Breanna as she tries to escape marrying a zombie king. Anthony examines bigotry and racism through her attitude toward zombies, which mirrors the feelings some have toward Breanna herself as she is black.Parallel to Breanna's story are the stories of Jenny, and of the kings of Xanth, who accidently drank Lethe water, causing them to forget where home was. Jenny, an elf and another non-native of Xanth, is writing invitations and planning a massive wedding, but no one knows who the bride is.\"Zombie Lover\" is a solid installment in the series, and is better than some of the recent Xanth books published.3/5.",

After being sent unwillingly back to his native planet, Carter is finally making his return to Barsoom. But instead of arriving at the land of Helium, he finds himself a world away from his Martian love—in the Valley of Dor. Controlled by the Therns, an alien race of self-proclaimed gods, the Valley of Dor is a dangerous realm from which no one has ever returned. There, Carter reunites with his Martian friend Tars Tarkas, and together they mount a daring escape.

But ironically, it's a paradise that soon turns into a kind of violent warring hell. The plant men are only the beginning. The bitterest enemies are a race of almost diabolical priests, the Tharns, who set loose white apes and plant men to slaughter thousands of religious pilgrims. I'm not spoiling the plot at all, since this becomes clear in the first two or three chapters.Again, there's a deep bond between the hero, John Carter, and a brave and stunning young woman named Thuvia. John Carter, a warlord, is not content to merely escape. He must somehow end this evil empire of hypocritical priests and mass slaughter.One fine element is the reintroduction of the green warrior chieftan, John's dear friend from the first novel in the series.There are strains of deeper thought woven throughout. For example, the biting satire against mindless &quot;fanatic&quot; religions.Heck of a book. Burroughs writes in a style that would seem a bit heavy today. But after a chapter or two, the reader usually can get in the stride. These books read fast-- you can't put them down. The heroines are GORGEOUS-- but the language is &quot;clean&quot; and the books can be recommended for teens. The description-- often in battle scenes-- is up to anything written in adventure science fiction today. This book was written-- amazingly-- in about 1917.",

          "comment": "Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1st, 1875 - March 19, 1950) continues the adventure started in \"A Princess of Mars\" in the sequel, \"The Gods of Mars\". This novel was published from January to May of 1913 in \"All-Story\" as a serial, and then published in book form in September of 1918. John Carter returns to Barsoom, finding if he were in time to save Barsoom at the end of the previous book, and searching for Princess Dejah Thoris who he left behind.As with the first book, this one opens with a foreword written by Burroughs, where he implies that this is a true story and that John Carter is real. The story then picks up with John Carter returning to Barsoom, but to an area which he has not seen before. He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \"heaven\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again. The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work.",

          "comment": "This continuation of the Barsoom series adds two more races of people to Martian life: blacks and whites. Despite being written prior to the civil rights movement in America, I felt E.R. Burroughs handled his depiction of black people remarkably well. He admits that black people are strong and beautiful, though they must ultimately be defeated and subdued by John Carter (like the other races).The hero's emergence as the undisputed ruler of all races through military prowess is still troubling. It is hypocritical for a man to condemn the Martians for their 'might makes right' mentality and call them heartless, and then conquer and pillage their cities.The pacing of action kept me interested throughout the novel, despite E.R. Burroughs' tendency toward verbosity. I rolled my eyes as each Martian declared their undying loyalty for John Carter and every woman swooned at his feet. John Carter was built up to be such a model of perfection that he seemed unreal. He was a super hero and not a real person despite the challenges he faced.Of course I am looking at this novel through modern eyes. Contemporary heroes have been transformed into average people that react in very human ways. It is perhaps unfair to judge this early fantasy character based on modern tastes, but I can't help thinking that John Carter would have been a more complete hero if he had shown some human weakness.",

          "comment": "Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1st, 1875 - March 19, 1950) continues the adventure started in \"A Princess of Mars\" in the sequel, \"The Gods of Mars\". This novel was published from January to May of 1913 in \"All-Story\" as a serial, and then published in book form in September of 1918. John Carter returns to Barsoom, finding if he were in time to save Barsoom at the end of the previous book, and searching for Princess Dejah Thoris who he left behind.As with the first book, this one opens with a foreword written by Burroughs, where he implies that this is a true story and that John Carter is real. The story then picks up with John Carter returning to Barsoom, but to an area which he has not seen before. He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \"heaven\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again. The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work.",

          "comment": "This book, #2 of 11 in Burroughs' John Carter series, is a direct sequel to the classic \"A Princess of Mars,\" and a reading of that earlier volume is fairly essential before going into this one. \"Gods...\" was first published in serial form in \"All-Story Magazine\" in 1913, and comprises one of Burroughs' earliest works. It is amazing how much action the author manages to cram into the book's 190 pages; on just about EVERY page there is some kind of incredible happening or colorful bit. The book really is hard to put down, and yet, at the same time, the end of just about every paragraph could serve as a cliffhanger! The pace of the book is brisk and relentless, and really carries the reader along to another great cliffhanger at the conclusion. In this volume, our hero, John Carter, returns to Barsoom after a decade's absence, and goes to that planet's \"heaven.\" But heaven turns out to be anything but, and our man gets caught up in battles with plant men and white apes, lost civilizations, religious taboos, the plots of an evil \"goddess,\" duels in the arena and on and on. There are two action set pieces that Burroughs really puts over well. One is the slave revolt that takes place halfway through the tale; the other, a bravura, four-way air battle between the forces of the black, white, red and green men of Barsoom. Both of these sections are thrilling in the extreme; better than anything in the first Barsoom novel. It's also nice that Carter, an Earthman on Mars, fights alongside men and women of varied races, colors, and religious beliefs in a common cause; there's some kind of message there--one for tolerance and brotherhood--that we could all avail ourselves of today.Having said all this, however, I must admit that there are problems in this novel that prevent me from giving it a top grade. These problems mainly take the form of fuzzy writing and internal inconsistencies. Burroughs, in this novel, does not do well in describing geography; his depictions of the Valley of the Therns, for example, are almost impossible to visualize (for me, anyway). A map of this planet (such as the one provided in LeGuin's Earthsea books) would have greatly helped, given Burroughs' inability to clearly set out his world. As for the inconsistencies: Burroughs, the \"editor\" of the novel, says he first read Carter's manuscript (for Book #1) 12 years previously; but if he had really obeyed Carter's will (that the manuscript not be opened for 11 years), then he would have only first seen the text of \"A Princess of Mars\" ONE year before! Tars Tarkas is said to be grieving over his kidnapped daughter in one section of this book; then, a few scenes later, he learns of this kidnapping for the first time. Huh?!?! The scene with Carter on the black-pirate cruiser contains many inconsistencies. Carter is said to be fighting five of these men; he kills three of them, and then three are left. Huh?!?! Six pirates are killed, all told, but later in the book, the number is said to be seven. Carter is said to have killed all these men single-handed, although the Thern princess, Phaidor, had helped him. These pirates are all asleep in the cruiser when Carter comes upon them, although they had been sacking the Thern temple scant minutes before. Does this seem likely? Inconsistencies such as this can drive an alert reader crazy. And don't even get me started on the redundant expressions such as \"haven of refuge\" and \"craven cowards\" that pop up all the time. Burroughs improved with age, but these early books are rife with problems that a good copyediting should have weeded out. Still, these minor problems are easily overlooked when one is caught up in the sweep of the story, and this story is as exciting as they come. It really is a tremendous feat of imagination, and one that any lover of swashbuckling fantasy should hugely enjoy.",

He must struggle to overcome them all, if he is to set free his beloved Dejah Thoris from a nested series of &quot;Heavens within Heavens.&quot;If he wins, will he kill the &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; in the title? What will happen to religion on Mars if he does? If he loses...........An ideal introduction to science fiction and fantasy for boys reaching puberty. They can sublimate their aggressive tendencies as they imagine themselves opposing plant men, white apes and other foes.",

In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley. Elzéard’s solitary, silent work continues and the narrator returns year after year to see the miracle he is gradually creating: a verdant, green landscape that is a testament to one man’s creative instinct.

If you've never read Dean Koontz, this is a great book to start with-it is a well-told story that adds to and magnifies Mary Shelly's tale. Oh, and one more thing: the chapters are all fairly short, which is something I haven't seen in a Dean Koontz novel.

Very well thought out.The character development is also very well done. Each character complex and likeable or hateable. But, as each character develops, there are zero dull spots in the book, as some novelists spend too much time trying to develop characers with too many words.The evil in this book outdoes most of Koontz's earler works. Sometimes I worry about Koontz, because these characters are so twisted and warped, I don't know if Koontz is quite sane or not.I loved it and look forward to Book 2.

          "comment": "Though a fan of Koontz, when I first saw the title of this book I was afraid it would be trite. But I was wrong. This is one of Koontz's best efforts in years. He does not rewrite the story of Frankenstein, rather, he builds on it.It is the present day and Dr. Frankenstein is alive and well and continuing his efforts. His goal is more clarified. He is no tragic figure, but an evil man bent on building a race of perfect beings that will replace humanity. Over the two hundred years since the events portrayed in Mary Shelley's book (which, in an nice twist, is explained as a semi-historical account based on legends and hearsay), Dr. Frankenstein has amassed a fortune and a vast biotech empire. Through modern genetics and science, he no longer has to piece together his creations from dead humans. He grows them and programs them with directives and information. He and his creations bide their time, infiltrate humanity, and await the time to strike openly.Opposing these efforts is Dr. Frakenstein's first creation. The Monster still lives, but has become more and more human while his creator has become less. Koontz and Anderson do a great job of portraying the monster as a suffering man, noble in spirit yet malformed in body. His path and mission cross paths with two homocide detectives on the trail of one of the New Race who has become a serial killer after he realizes that his programing and superior genetics has left him empty, missing something that humans seem to possess.Koontz and Anderson's decision to place the story in New Orleans was a stroke of genius. They do a good job of capturing the mood of what is perhaps America's most foreign, haunted city. The food, the history, the music, the graveyards. All are effecitvely portrayed and woven into the story.The book is a quick read, with 4-5 page chapters dealing with one sequence of events, the moving to another. Despite this, it does not come across choppy. The writers keep the pace going while making the narrative clear.A good book. Reminscent of, though not quite at the level of, Koontz's excellent Twilight Eyes.",

          "comment": "Just as we don't watch films like \"Spider-Man\" and television shows like \"Heroes\" for their brilliant acting and creative cinematography, we don't read Dean Koontz novels for their literary value. How else could you explain the ability to read a novel that nears 500 pages in a matter of two days? That being said, we still enjoy those types of films and shows for the value they do offer: they help us escape our mundane lives through fantastic storytelling and fast-paced action. This is what you should expect from Prodigal Son, the first book in the straight-to-paperback Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series.The story takes place two hundred years after the end of Mary Shelley's classic novel, in modern-era New Orleans where Frankenstein's monster, having renamed his self Deucalion, is working closely with two homicide detectives on the trail of the copycat serial killers. One killer, having previously been hell-bent on ridding the human race of ugly people, has switched motives to collecting the most beautiful female body parts he can find. The other, a genetically engineered evolutionary advancement created by Victor Helios (aka Frankenstein) is gutting male victims in attempt of discovering the part of the human race that he lacks: the source of happiness.Koontz's signature short chapters are action-packed and move the story along quickly. As is the case with his other novels, the supernatural and/or abominable nature of science fiction plays an important role in the story's development. Those facets always seem to give Koontz an easy escape from tricky plot developments. Nevertheless, the novel is a valid contribution for its unique monsters and the creative villainy of Victor Helios.If you're in the mood for \"Shakespeare in Love\" or \"The Shawshank Redeption,\" read something else. If you're craving a mindless horror flick, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein: Prodigal Son (Book One) is worth two or three days of your reading list's time.",

We could go so far as to call it an Odd road.What I can tell you is this--that while Koontz's Frankenstein is unspeakably more bloody and peculiar than his difficult but touching Odd Thomas books, it is every bit as satisfying a piece of writing. It is a compulsive read, and it tells the truth within the lie of fiction.It is not for the faint of heart. But if you are willing to think about the existence of evil, and if you are willing to believe that there are still people who give up everything to combat it--if you hope that if need be, you might be one of those people--this frightening series set so perfectly in New-Orleans-That-Was is for you.Deucalion--and Cheez-Its!--forever!",

I got the book because it was just a regular paperback, planning on reading it much later in the year than now. But when you hear all the hype about this, for once just believe it and find out for yourself! Approach with caution, it'll grip you from the first page! Then the nouns, verbs, adjectives, all that good stuff just falls into place. The excitement Koontz serves up is very electrifying in more than one way! OK!Join EVERYBODY from Deucalion, the tattooed man, Carson O'Connor, the NO-FEAR detective, her partner, the arrogant, yet somewhat laid back, Michael Maddison. How long has Deucalion been dealing with his situation? What is his purpose? Maybe ask yourself how long this dude's actually been around for! You'll find out.At the same time, drink in the anxiety of Randall Six, with his crossword puzzles and daily routine. Yet stagger with fear while you observe Dr. Victor Helios. What kind of a man is the good doctor? Hey, is he a good doctor? How long must one endure? Enjoy the human side of all sides of this creation! Koontz quotes the great C.S. Lewis to prepare us, yet humbles even the likes of one Mary Shelley. Have I read Shelley's version? Nope? Am I likely to? Probably not. I think if Koontz were to hear that this isn't like Shelley's original, he'd probably be the first to say thank you. It wasn't meant to be.As usual with Koontz, expect the unexpected! Be pleased with as surprises arise, yet let your heart share in small bits of sorrow. But don't be surprised if you steal a few laughs as you bite off that last fingernail! We don't know what will happen next, but I do know this. I can't wait for more! The question is, do you dare take the risk of this first book?",

But Koontz comes at this classic tale with his own scythe ready to cause a change of faith in the fans of the original. This is not so much a remake as a supplement to the classic tale. Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue.",

The heroine, Taffy starts off in the 1880's and ends up in the 1640's. She is helping her father with his archeology by taking photographs of the bones they have discovered of a piper. The piper was killed after warning of a trap. His hands had been cut off and he bled to death. While taking the shot she sees a ghost who happens to be the piper himself. The piper, Malcolm, is our hero. She is sent back in time to save him by the fairies. She and he both are of fairy blood and the fairies need them.Together they must overcome their human enemies and the fairy dangers which await them. I enjoyed the excitement in this book.

      "description": "The Forsyte Saga was the title originally destined for that part of it which is called The Man of Property; and to adopt it for the collected chronicles of the Forsyte family has indulged the Forsytean tenacity that is in all of us. The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts to talk them out.",

          "comment": "The Forsyte Saga is a sprawling drama in 3 Volumes/novels which won John Galsworthy the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. I enjoyed all 3 Volumes immensely - the writing is most beautiful, the storylines absorbing, the characters felt \"real\" and the dialogue wonderfully engaging.All 3 Volumes are published by Penguin. Each Volume has 800-900 pages and is divided into 3 Books:1. Volume 1: \"The Man of Property\", \"In Chancery\" and \"To Let\".2. Volume 2: \"The White Monkey\", \"The Silver Spoon\" and \"Swan Song\".3. Volume 3: \"Maid In Waiting\", \"Flowering Wilderness\" and \"Over the River\".Here's the gist of the story from each Volume:Volume 1: Meet the Forsytes - a rich, upper-class family in old England. Before you start, study the 'Family Tree' page first because it's helpful to remember how the numerous major characters are related. Note: My review will not be revealing any plot that you can't already gather from the Family Tree. The story begins in the late 1870s with Soames Forsyte (an old-fashioned, smart solicitor and art-collector) falling in love with a penniless beauty, Irene (pron.: \"I-re-nee\"). They marry but Irene is unhappy because she does not love Soames. Later, she meets a young architect, Philip Bosinney - they fall in love and have an affair. Problem is, Philip is June Forsyte (Soames' niece)'s fiance. Suspense, drama and great tragedy ensue when Soames and June find out. Some years pass. Jolyon (a cousin of Soames and an outcast of the family) and Irene are thrown together by circumstances and they fall in love. Irene has his child, Jon. Soames is heartbroken a second time. There is a bitter divorce. Soames later marries a French woman, Annette and they have a child, Fleur. Fleur and Jon grow up and fall in love with each other, unaware of the feud between their families...Note: Both the book and TV-series (adapted in 2002) feature Chopin's music (which is played by Irene on the piano). So if you like Chopin, you'll be pleased! Another thing is that the reader will either love/hate Irene. The author only describes her actions, but never let us know her thoughts or feelings. Everything we read about Irene is from the eyes or viewpoint of the other characters. Hence, on the pages, she appears cold and distant. Personally, I do not like Irene; my sympathy lies with Soames (whom I feel is unfairly and cruelly treated by Irene).Volume 2 is about Fleur and her relationship with her ageing father (Soames) and her husband (Michael Mont). Initially, Fleur appears to handle married life well - 'grooming' her husband for Parliament and throwing social parties. But 3 crises emerge to test her: a court action filed by a former friend (lots of mud-slinging here), having to \"manage\" Wilfrid Desert (her husband's best friend who is in love with her) and the return of Jon to England and their rekindled love. There is also an engaging subplot involving an impoverished balloon-seller, Tony Bicket and his wife.Volume 3 is unputdownable (like Volume 1). Here, we meet the Charwells, distant relations of the Forsytes (Michael Mont's mother is a Charwell). The time period is 1920s to early 1930s. The heroine is Elizabeth (\"Dinny\"), a most charming and endearing character. In Book 1, she tries to help her brother, Hubert who faces a murder charge. She also has to fend off 2 (unwelcome) admirers. In Book 2, Dinny falls in love (at last) with someone who first appeared in Volume 2. Their relationship is not smooth-sailing and you just know Dinny is headed for a heartbreak. There is also a troubling religion issue with no practical solution in sight. In Book 3, Dinny helps her younger sister, Clare who runs away after physical abuse by her husband. There is later a court proceeding (which is superbly written). Meanwhile, Fleur provides some smart advice and shows her generosity in an unexpected way. As for Dinny, she has not recovered from her earlier heartbreak but a new suitor appears on the scene (and he is really quite perfect...). Volume 3 is romantic and I loved it best.The Forstye Saga is a glorious and unforgetable read. It has the power to draw every sorts of emotion from the reader (joy, sadness, suspense, anger, laughter, tears). Put this title high on your list of must-reads. All 3 Volumes are highly recommended!",

Although it very quickly went out of fashion among the modernist writers of his time, THE FORSYTE SAGA has remained a popular hit, inspiring no less than two famous BBC mini-series. And it's the real deal: I can think of few novel cycles that are as satisfying or as eminently readable, much less that are as minutely crafted. (The continuing themes of possesion and death cycle throughout the saga in such fascinating ways that it is almost impossible to believe Galsworthy wrote the first novel, THE MAN OF PROPERTY, without intending to build a trilogy out of it.)

          "comment": "Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \"The Forsyte Saga,\" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \"Saga\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to \"own\" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than \"property.\"The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English \"Age of Innocence.\" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (\"Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl\") and lushly written descriptives (\"... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago\").Yet there are touching moments too, like Old Jolyon paying a visit to his estranged son and his lower-class second wife, and the grandchildren he has never met. The awkwardness, love and pain in these scenes is truly astounding.As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to \"own\" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the \"Forsye Saga,\" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.",

          "comment": "\"The Forsyte Saga\" is a monumental masterpiece reaching the highest level of narrative skills and literary beauty.Mostly known for the television adaptation, this heck of the book is no less amusing than BBC Masterpiece Theater, even more... it surpasses television genre in what it's always appreciated by the readers - art of the written language.Despite its length, events which are taken place in the lives of three generation of Forsytes, are hugely engaging and elegantly placed in the background of Victorian and post Victorian era, wonderfully described by the author. For that reason I didn't have any problem to \"travel\" through the book pages without slightest feeling of boredom or exhaustion from reading.As a reader it is so easy to quickly befriend some of the main characters, as well as find almost personal grudges toward less amiable personalities like unimaginative, solicitor Soams (\"Man of the Property\"), who's obsession with acquiring goods, degrades even his wives to the level of material assets. In the first group I would definitely include the Old Jolyon, for whom John Galsworthy dedicated entire interlude between first and second part of the book, and which is one of the most charming and poetic sequence in the novel.I found Galsworthy narrative to be extremely clever, elegant, observant, poetic, up to the point of the highest level in art. The only sadness which I feel is that many times I found this beautiful literary creation, to be underrated and not included in the list of \"must read books\" of 20 century.",

          "comment": "The first volume of \"The Forsyte Saga\" contains three novels and two interludes between each. It chronicles the lives of the Forsyte family between more than 30 years. In his narrative, John Galsworthy deals not only with the family's fortunes but also the society of their time, and its changes.\"The Man of Property\" is the first novel of the monumental Forsyte Saga and in the beginning the writer spends some time creating his environment where those Forsyte will inhabit.The first chapters turn out to be the more descriptive in the book. Not only does he introduces the most important members of the family, but he also describe their moral-social relationships -- that count much more than their blood relations.Once Galsworthy feels that his characters are established -- and it doesn't take too many pages, as a matter of fact -- he starts the narrative per se, although a slight plot has been developed from the beginning.\"The Man of Property\" concerns more on old Jolyon Forsyte's life and his son and his nephew Soames and Soames' wife, Irene (one of the most unforgettable characters in the saga). Soames is the man of property, but not only has he got unanimated properties but he also considers himself the owner of Irene. She will involve herself with another man, and this love affair will affect the all Forsytes in some levels.This novel is a great beginning for Galsworthy's saga, with vivid characters, a well-built plot and charming writing. While the writer is developing the family affairs, he has the chance to portray the changes in the high society life in the early XX Century in England.In the second installment of \"The Forsyte Saga\", the writer reassumes the life of the Forsyte family. \"In Chancery\" is situated a few years after the events told in \"The Man of Property\", in a few pages recaps some of the most important facts of the first book and their aftermath. After that he is able to move on.And on he moves -- but the narrative still concerns on young Jolyon, Soames and Irene that forms a love triangle. While the remaining Jolyon become a close friend to Irene, her ex-husband --from whom she hasn't divorced in all those years -- fells jealous and considers claiming his wife back.Needless to say that this is not the only plot in the novel. Galsworthy develops more family plots. It is impossible not to have the feeling that while he is sometimes depicting the shallowness of the elite from his time, at the same time he has an indulgent look upon the rich and wealthy -- which is not a bad thing as a matter of fact.Those who like \"The Man of Property\" will certainly find more pleasure in \"In Chancery\". He finishes the book with the perfect hook what will come next.For those who liked \"The Man of Property\" \"In Chancery\", \"To Let\" is a treat. At this point we are in a transition. The old school of Forytes (Jolyon, Soames...) is about to `resign', while new folks are starting to assume the power and the money (Jolyon's third son, Soames' daughter...). The very old Forsyte school, by the way, is already history.\"To Let\" is a novel of transition; it is as if the parents are passing the command to their kids -- at least in terms of narrative. That is why old plots (Irene, Somaes, Jolyon) and new ones are in the center of the narrative.The story is set some twenty years after the ending of \"In Chancery\", Soames' and Jolyon's kids are virtually adults but they don't know the plot involving their parents (the story of the first and second novel) and are ready to fall in love. It is not surprise that Fleur (Jolyon's French kid) will fall in love with Jon (Jolyon's third son also named Jolyon).But their main obstacle is not the fact that they are cousins, but the relations from the past. The narrative will focus on this Romeo and Juliet-esque couple whose union --or separation-- lies in a secret hidden in the past.Those who have reached the third installment in the saga are those who have liked it and are looking forward to see what will happen to the Forsyte. So it is no mystery that Galsworthy exploits the family changes as a shadow of the change in their society --set about the 20's of the XX Century. As Britain Empire declines, so does the power of the Forsytes that cannot avoid their hidden skeletons.",

          "comment": "Galsworthy's \"The Forsyte Saga\" is simply masterful. A society epic, a romance, a satire, a character study, and a concept examination (of the effects of beauty on people's lives), the Forsyte Saga tells many stories but centers on the tragic marriage of Irene and Soames. Irene has married Soames under duress from her stepmother, and she detests him. Soames views all things in his world as possessions, including Irene. The tragedy of this marriage begets more tragedies among other characters who swirl into and out of the narrative. Other, unrelated tragedies in the Forsyte family dovetail with Irene and Soames's as we come to know a great number of aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and cousins. But \"The Forsyte Saga\" is not all heavy; many of the characters are terribly funny (what could be better than senile aunties?), and Galsworthy's comments on society are acutely witty. Galsworthy draws his characters so superbly that when the books first came out, readers wrote to him claiming that he must have based characters off of acquaintances of theirs. Galsworthy's prose is elegant, fluid, and sparkling with energy, making \"The Forsyte Saga\" beautiful and very readable, despite its heft.",

          "comment": "John Galsworthy (never \"Sir John\" only by his own choice, though he did accept the Order of Merit), one of the notable British writers of the first quarter of the 20th century, has subsequently faded somewhat from the canon of British writers in the 20th century, despite his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. Galsworthy was a very traditional Victorian/Edwardian writer in his style, despite making his books social criticisms of Victorian/Edwardian values; his best work coincided with the rise of artistic modernism, which has tended to overshadow his more traditional approach. \"The Forsyte Saga\", a collection of three novels linked by two short stories, is Galsworthy's magnum opus, and has been twice adapted by the BBC into major miniseries (first and most famously in 1967, and again in 2002); it has lingered moreso in the public consciousness than its author. This large volume collects the entirety of the original quintology (some spoilers follow).The first (and, originally planned to be the only) novel in the series, \"The Man of Property\", was published in 1906, and set in the high Victorian period, focussing on the Forsyte family, the numerous long-lived sons and daughters of Jolyon 'Superior Dorset' Forsyte, and their own descendants. There is Old Jolyon ('Superior''s eldest son), who has estranged himself from his son Young Jolyon for the latter's scandalous affair, and has raised his daughter June, who is engaged to an architect; and Soames Forsyte, the son of Jolyon's brother James, who is married to Irene, and commissions the architect to build a house that he hopes will help revive the passion in his relationship with Irene.Galsworthy's twin focuses, which carry on through the whole series, are the strictures of Victorian values of commerce and proper behaviour (which particularly impact the two Jolyons), and the subordinate legal position of women in society (though the ridiculous divorce laws also hamstring men, as we later see). These carry on through the subsequent novels, published more than a decade after, and the two short stories (the second short story, \"Awakenings\", is honestly pretty throwaway, but \"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\" is lovely). Galsworthy's writing style is eminently restrained; Soames' decision to force himself on his wife Irene near the climax of the first novel is only described briefly in a single paragraph, and the nature of this act is never verbalized (or even narrated) by anyone for almost the entire remainder of the trilogy, even though it is absolutely essential to understanding what's going on. Stiff upper lip, indeed. The characterization really sells the story; the plots are frequently not anything to write home about (the third novel even opens with a quote from \"Romeo and Juliet\", which would tell people in fair detail how the entire main storyline will play out, until the very end, which is more muted).Recommended.",

          "comment": "I originally posted this review anonymously.20 of 25 people found the following review helpful3.0 out of 5 stars WHO NEEDS HAPPINESS WHEN ONE CAN HAVE APPEARANCES?, September 6, 1998By A CustomerThis review is from: The Forsyte Saga (Windsor Selections) (Hardcover)Re: THE MAN OF PROPERTYStep into the world of upper middleclass London of the late Victorian era, staunchly embodied in the several brothers Forsyte, their sisters, children, inlaws and grandchildren. It's a world motivated by keeping up appearances and exercising the strictest control over expression of one's emotions -- that is, if one is to preserve one's status as a proper member of the upper middleclass. Indeed, the only safe emotion is curiosity about how much others have paid for their possessions and whether they are to be congratulated or envied for acquiring something for nothing, or shall they be sneered at and ridiculed for having paid more. The Forsytes are a commercial bunch, everything boils down to financial value for them -- even relationships bear price tags.Old Jolyon is patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Unlike his brothers, he is now scornful of that middleclass ethos they so highly value, often to their detriment. Old Jolyon has lived long enough to regret his deference to appearances, which had cost him his relationship with his only son.The author's indictment against the stern, uncharitable principles cherished by the British upper middleclass is peppered throughout the narration, the characters always replacing any thoughts toward generosity with sound justification (read: excuse) for niggardly self interest. We are used to categorizing characters as victims, villains and heroes. However, in this story it can be argued that everyone is a victim; there are no real heroes or real villains. Because of his unsympathetic nature, cousin Soames might appear a villain, but truly he is as tragic a figure as Mr. Bosinney (the fiance of June, Old Jolyon's granddaughter) who is in love with the tragically beautiful Irene, Soames's wife. Although the reader is generously privy to the thoughts and feelings of the members of the clan, including disagreeable inlaws, it is noteworthy that the reader is only aware of the two tragic characters, Bosinney and Irene, as they are observed by others. The author never allows the reader to trespass directly into their souls to expose all therein. Fortunately for us, these two wear their hearts on their sleeves and others are thereby enabled to read volumes simply by taking advantage of brief observations. We see the reactions of Irene and Bosinney, never their internal motivations.The title of this book begs the question, exactly who is the man of property or to which man of property does the title refer -- and what exactly is the property that is referenced. Ultimately cousin Soames is the man specifically identified in the title, and surely the property particularly stressed is his unyielding wife, the incomparable Irene. Irene is so much the sophisticated lady, so beguiling in appearance and manner, I am reminded of Jane Austen's \"dear Jane Fairfax\" (\"Emma\") who, like dear Irene, has no money of her own and therefore is compelled to select between the lesser of two (or more) quite unattractive situations. For certainly, when one's station is so reduced, being without the means to _choose_ between this pleasant possibility and that pleasant circumstance, one simply must _decide_ which evil will produce the least harm. In The Man of Property, everyone is selecting -- sometimes their choices backfire and then they must decide the next step. June happily _chose_ to become engaged to marry Bosinney, but later she has to _decide_ how best to keep him or even whether she is at all capable of keeping him.Bosinney also brings to mind another brooding young man from literature -- Mr. Ladislaw of George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\", who also was tragically in love with another man's wife. Indeed, when reading the description of Bosinney's high cheek bones, casual manners and the intensity of his emotions, one might be tempted to cast the actor Rufus Sewell in that role; for Sewell's portrayal of Ladislaw was quite memorable in the Masterpiece Theatre television adaptation of \"Middlemarch\", another story about keeping up appearances and making happy choices or miserable decisions.The Man of Property moves along very quickly. The author's descriptions of the lifestyle and environment of that time are quite detailed. But for the selfish and unpleasant people who populate this world, the sensitive reader might easily drift into this other time and other place, which for this reader is the mark of a truly rich literary experience.",

Succinct it definitely is, which means that military campaigns requiring a great deal of detail tend to be a little dry, while Napoleon's coronation (depicted by David as one of the great spectacles in the first half of the 19th Century) is covered by Markham in a few brush strokes. The true value of the book, aside from its synopsis of a dazzling history, is Markham's incisive study of Napoleon's personality and the enormous effect he had on his generation as well as those to come. Junot is quoted as saying: &quot;He is the sort of man of whom nature is sparing and who only appears on earth at intervals of centuries.&quot; Napoleon's wisdom as an administrator is set against his occasional brutality, as when he had 3,000 prisoners shot to death at Jaffa or somewhat arbitrarily ordered the execution of the Duc d'Enghien. (It was the latter act that caused Beethoven to cross out the &quot;Eroica&quot; dedication.) Markham debunks some Napoleonic myths, including my favorite that Napoleon subsisted on only four hours of sleep per day, plus power naps. And for those of us who think of Napoleon's rise to power as an unobstructed arc of triumph, Markham reminds us that in the early part of his career Napoleon came more than once under the shadow of the guillotine. There are 38 illustrations and, like the text, they provide a sort of pr&eacute;cis of this extraordinary life. The portraits of Napoleon from the 1790's depict him in dramatic poses, his hair blowing in the wind, very much like a 1940's movie star. These contrast sadly with the St Helena pictures, the ex-Emperor leaning on a spade in his garden, looking tamed and resigned. From triumphant Emperor to tired exile, Felix Markham presents a &quot;Napoleon&quot; that is short but strong.",

          "comment": "This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin, the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea), am interested in Latin American culture, and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses, she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician, after all, not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking, and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably, but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships, we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive, some die, but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general, and a book in a similar vein, that of a doctor practicing &quot;backwoods medicine&quot; that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea, in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous, extremely outstanding work, is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this, I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there, revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the &quot;problem&quot; can be seen right in her acknowledgements, when, regarding her publishers, she writes that they &quot;gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.&quot; Sorry, but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician, not a professional writer, and though this effort is quite passable, it could have been so much better.The book is informative, educational up to a point, gives a good perspective on &quot;jungle&quot; medicine&quot; vs. the US mainstream practice thereof, and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced, when she said that the inhabitants, almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty, &quot;seemed happy.&quot; This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who, many contended &quot;seemed happy.&quot;) There are a few funny moments, especially when Dr. Linnea describes w/ dead-on accuracy her encounters with the Peruvian bureaucracy, redtape and corruption.All in all, well worth reading, but don't expect great emotional engagement or gripping human drama.",

(I believe it was ghost written, which is probably not unusual.)Jackie and I spent a few days at Explorama and talked at some length with Dr. Linnea. This book is not embellished in any way. This is an accurate account of life in that part of the world.Her descriptions of places were perfectly clear to me, since I've been there. It's hard to know how these descriptions will play out in the mind's eye of other readers. The beginning of the book was particularly fascinating.Our face-to-face meeting left me with the impression that she is not trying to run away from society, not trying to crusade for the underprivileged, not trying to be &quot;holier than thou&quot;. She really likes what she is doing. The book confirms this.When you read this book you are looking inside La Doctora. Nothing is hidden. There are no pretenses. She is simply good people.Incidently, she wanted the book named &quot;At the River's Edge&quot; and the publishers wanted &quot;La Doctora&quot;. The publishers won.",

Some find the lack of emotional engagement disappointing, wishing for more depth in character development. However, it is praised for its informative and educational content, cultural sensitivity, and humor. On the other hand, Dr. Smith's diary of experiences in the same region is commended for her dedication and making a difference.

          "comment": "Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this book is the apparently wholehearted acceptance that its dated and dangerous ideas seem to have found, at least as evidenced by a cursory reading of the reviews. What in the world gives Huxley the right to revise civilization? The fact that he is well-read? His adoption of discredited oriental philosophies?It cannot be argued that Western Civilization is without room for much improvement; however, abandonment of family, use of \"mind-expanding\" drugs, renunciation of religion, modification of accepted societal behavior, repudiation of long-standing definitions of acceptable sexual conduct, etc. These have all been tried to some extent and have universally failed. Huxley merely puts a fine gloss on the 20th Century's disdain of tried and true principles.Strong families supported by public morality and high expectations with respect to ethical behavior are the means whereby society will advance. History has proven this to be the case. It is no accident that English has become the language of the world--despite its many flaws, the rule of law and its protections of freedom and private property have given us the world we now, apparently, seek to destroy.Huxley and his ilk would have us believe that our civilization is so inherently superior to all others that we are free to ignore the lessons of history. However, it is more likely than not that humanity's basic nature remains the same today as hundreds of years ago. For example, regardless of your religious persuasions and beliefs, one must acknowledge that the Jewish culture has proven remarkably adaptive and has a longevity that is the envy of any cultural group--they have kept their people together through thousands of years of history by following some simple rules that Mr. Huxley would throw out the window.Despite the superficial attractiveness of Huxley's easy philosophy, hard work and obedience to laws will paradoxically produce far more freedom than a slothful abandonment to what feels good.",

          "comment": "I kept reading this book because on some level I was just waiting for something to happen. There were a couple of conflicts that could come to head somehow and make the book interesting in the \"I'm reading a fictional narrative sort of way\". However, none of these became more than hints until the very last two pages of the book. When this happens it seems like some predetermined anticlimax that you have been waiting for all along. The book fails as a narrative which is a problem when the publishers want to sell it as fiction.The problem is that it is not a work of fiction but is more a work of philosophy as story. I kept thinking ofCandideorGulliver's Travels (Oxford World's Classics). The problem is that Voltaire and Swift's works were at the bottom much more interestingly told. Island is the vehicle for Huxley to lay out his real utopia devised after a lifetime of intellectual work. The protagonist and the reader are guided around the island to learn about the pro-Buddhist, pro-hallucinatory drug, pro-sex, and anti(capitalist, communist, consumption, western education, nuclear family, etc) philosophy.This journey, as the protagonist learns and starts to internalize the teachings of the island, comes to an end based on the forces that represent the bad in the world. Poor Huxley's utopia even though isolated from the world cannot survive as the very nature of the philosophy is non-violent and acquiescent. It contains the seeds of its own destruction. I cannot help but think how much Huxley hated modernity and hoped for and sought a world beyond this one in the form of religion and drugs. For him, the struggle was not about the control of the means of production, but whether the means of production should exist. I just think he should thank his stars that he did not live to see the Brave New World in the flower as we can see it.",

I believe this book invokes numerous topics of discussion be it politics, capitalism, individuality, spirituality, etc. I personally feel out of all those components I listed above Huxley emphasizes the concept of spirituality, particularly Buddhist philosophies. I believe Will Faranby was both a protagonist and a antagonist, but thats open to interpretation. Huxley wrote this book giving the reader an opportunity to see how spirituality shapes and impacts a persons perception of him/herself (the being) and the world. The book centered around the progression of Will Faranby's introspective of consciousness. Huxley incorporated hallucinogenics aka moksha-medicine as being totally appropriate and relevant to the characters development, thus solidifying Farnaby's introspective of himself. In essence, the moksha-medicine was an eye-opening, yet intense experience that ultimately gave the main character a deeper awareness to the world and his own personal existence (the being).",

          "comment": "Huxley gives us a lot to ponder in his \"utopian\" schemata. His satirical and humorous protagonist, Farnaby, was hilarious. His snide comments and thoughts made me laugh out loud at times. I felt Huxley's writing style was much clearer and more accessible than A Brave New World and as a result I liked Island much better. Island reflects a great deal of cynicism about America and the world. Huxley attacks, among other things (1) consumerism; (2) the cold war ideology of both the capitalistic west and the socialist east; (3) religious suppression of the right of others to develop and practice their own sexual and other \"private\" mores and the use of the state to further this suppression; (4) violence and militarism clothed in religion, progress (technological and moral), and so called freedom; (5) political and social corruption of corporatism and the power of corporations and those that control them to use their resources for political power.The key point I feel Huxley makes is that capitalistic or corporate power in the west is able to use it vast resources to obtain what it desires. Corporate power uses money, religion, and the greed of the State to pursue its ends. Had the leaders of Pala given into greed then the Island would not have suffered its eventual fate at the hands of an outside force--but would have suffered an erosion of its \"utopian\" nature and everyone except the greedy would have lost in the end anyway. But either way it is clear that the corporate interests will take what it desires and use the tools of religious fervor and state power to further their own ends. Its key resource, however, is still MONEY---and in pursuit of what?----more MONEY. The happiness of everyday citizens is sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed.Island was published in 1962 and really reflects Huxley's views, I suspect, of the latter half of the 1950's. Interestingly, the 1950's are marked by (1) the true rise of consumerism and corporate exploitation of American demand for goods; (2) entrenchment of the Cold War and suppression of individual rights and free thought based on ideological extremism (McCarthy, Hoover, John Foster Dulles, Castro, and Stalin are all towering figures of the 1950s); (3) the emerging battle and public expression of a new set of sexual mores which met a backlash by conservative/religious segments of society; (4) The emergence of cold war capitalism fueled both by American defense corporations and the attempt of the Soviet Union to catch up with the west in terms of industrialization and military might (Eisenhower, during his Presidency, warned of the might of the military industrial complex). Some argue the entire cold war was generated by the greed of American defense industries (this is far-fetched in my opinion).The scary thing about all this--the same set of circumstances can be said to have exit today, despite the end of the cold war. Certainly, the power of corporations to dominate the political agenda and decision making process is still intact. Whether this limits or threatens individual liberties and democracy is another question. Certainly it did in the 1950's in America. It is amazing to me the correlation between the 1950's and the 1980's at the height of the cold war in American History. (For more information on the 1950's in this country I would recommend a perusal of David Halberstam's The 1950's). Huxley's book is as timely and poignant today as it was in 1962. The right or ability of an individual and a society to choose how it is going to live and progress is as impeded today as it was in the early 1960's---and by the same forces.Some rogue comments:1. I found the discussion of \"maithuna\" or the \"yoga of love\" to be quite humorous. I especially liked Farnaby's snide thought \"What shall be do to be saved? The answer is in four letters\". Is there really such a thing as \"maithuna\"?2. The use of mind altering drugs for experiencing a different slice of reality was provocative. Huxley wrote a book called \"The Doors of Perception\" which I have not read. I found these elements of the book to be interesting and really wanted more explication on the subject.3. The commentary on population control was also quite timely then and now. This exchange I found quite clear and commonsensical:Farnaby: \"You seem to have solved your economic problems [on the Island] pretty successfully\".Dr. Robert: \"Solving them wasn't difficult. To begin with, we never allowed ourselves to produce more children than we could feed, clothe, house, and educate into something like full humanity\".4. One of the scary pitfalls of the book is the Island's use of psychological drugs to control and shape the personality of its children so they don't grow up to be problems. Huxley, I felt, placed too much trust in science and medicine in this instance. This seemed to me like something not out of a peaceful utopian society but \"A Clockwork Orange\" (see p. 154-155 of the Perennial Library paperback edition for the reference-about 2/3rds into chapter 9).5. I know little about Buddhism and Yoga so those parts of the books I did not get as much out of, although I found them of interest. I wonder why he chose forms of these religions as those most applicable to his utopia as opposed to atheism or some form of spiritualistic religion other than Buddhism?One last comment: The ending was perfect in its cynicism.

Huxley is not quite able to deliver here. In short: in comparison to Brave New World, which is a masterly critique of the way things are headed (I strongly recommend supplementing with BNW Revisited), this vision of what things might be pales.This book is built as a dialogue between the West (Farnaby) and various elements of a better society (characters of Pala). Many of the conversations are outstanding and revealing. Huxley obviously had a great intuitive feel for humans and their trajectory when operating in a Western, consumer driven system. There are many great insights that you will literally not find in any other work. I think most books of Huxley are worth reading for these revelations alone. This is not to say that he is an infallible sage type. For example, he recommends hormonally modifying youngsters if they are too \"muscle bound\" or \"inferior\". Then we wouldn't have such a risk of psychopathic dictators... Not sure he truly appreciated man's lust for greed and his boundless capacity for self-delusion.However, as Huxley alludes to himself,he is not the great poet that can thrill us with harmonious language and thrilling plot. While the middle sections move well, the beginning and conclusion are hard to follow with any passionate interest. Sir Thomas Moore's \"Utopia\" was far more engaging because of the great humor and satirical elements employed. Huxley must surely be lacking in a sense of humor, a deficit which is sorely missed when such a grave topic is handled.In conclusion, this book is a must read. I only wish Huxley stuck with more of a non-fiction approach, as his contemporary Bertrand Russell wrote in because he is a direct writer and incredibly logical. These strengths make his fictional writing unnecessarily tedious and preachy, which was a common criticism among his readership of the time.",

          "comment": "Whew, am I glad to be finished with this book. It was very heavy reading, and boring as well. I'm glad I did read it, just so I know what it's all about, since it is a well-known classic by a famous author. But I'm so glad to be done, it was a real slog to get through.It is the antithesis of *Brave New World*, a Utopian vision rather than a Dystopian one. The thing is, it is only very thinly disguised as a novel. Except for the main character, there's not a lot of character development, and practically no plot at all. Nothing happens except at the very beginning and very end (and even then, not much.)What it really is, is a discussion of Huxley's theory of what it would take to create Utopia. If this is something you are passionately interested in, and you are reading it as such rather than as a novel, you would perhaps appreciate it. The story mainly consists of the main character going around touring an island country while different residents explain all the elements that make their society so ideal. It is a series of highly abstract, esoteric discussions mainly of philosophy and spirituality, told in \"appropriate\" weighty language (i.e., the heaviness of the language is apparently intended to convey the seriousness of the subject. In case we don't get that.)I didn't buy Huxley's vision, either. Many of the foundations he proposes for the building of a Utopia are either realistically impossible, almost childishly naive and pie-in-the-sky, or both. For example, magic mushrooms whose effects are only vaguely described (to me it appeared that all they did was get people stoned to the point of hallucination) but were essential to impart transcendence and make a person \"fully human.\" And being able to identify and cure young children who would otherwise grow up to be violent, sociopathic, self-destructive, etc. And getting everyone over the age of 15 to practice Tantric sex, and only Tantric sex. (Can you imagine a 15-year-old boy being able to do that, or even wanting to try?) True, these impossibilities are supposedly excused by being under the umbrella of fiction, but the actual result is that the book doesn't really succeed as either fiction OR nonfiction.I was also put off by Huxley's unadulterated and open contempt for anyone who was overweight. And by his (perhaps unconscious) apparent pedophilia. I wish I'd kept a tally of how many times he ecstatically described the breasts of pubescent girls (naturally, they were always bare in his utopia.) I'm betting such descriptions would number in the double digits.The one thing I did like about this book was that when he wasn't being portentously weighty, Huxley's descriptions are gorgeous and lyrical. For example, I loved the care-crows (scarecrows) and the Japanese Hornpipe dance.If you've never read Aldous Huxley before, I recommend giving this a skip and reading *Brave New World* instead. That one is quite interesting. It's hard to believe the two books were written by the same person.(286 pages)I did get some good quotes from *Island*:\"Both of us victims of the same twentieth-century plague. Not the Black Death this time; the Grey Life.\"\"I have a theory that, whenever little boys and girls are systematically flagellated, the victims grow up to think of God as 'Wholly Other' -- isn't that the fashionable *argot* in your part of the world? Wherever, on the contrary, children are brought up without being subjected to physical violence, God is immanent. A people's theology reflects the state of its children's bottoms.\"\". . . she was slowly, and with a great deal of pain, put to death in solitude. In solitude . . . For of course nobody can help, nobody can ever be present. People may stand by while you're suffering and dying; but they're standing by in another world. In *your* world you're absolutely alone. Alone in your suffering and your dying, just as you're alone in love, alone even in the most completely shared pleasure.\"",

I'm writing this review as I read the final pages of this book. However much of a clich&eacute; it is, I could not put it down, even at one AM. In the library, in my hometown, this book was classified as science fiction, but truly, it's more of a spiritual quest. The main character, Will started in the beginning of the book as a cynical, pessimistic man, but transformed drastically by the end. I think that throughout the book, I made a transformation too. If fiction can change one's life, it undoubtedly has changed mine.",

          "comment": "\"Attention!\" cries the talking bird at the end of the book when tiny Pala, the island utopia its inhabitants have tried so diligently to perfect and stay apart from the world, is finally overrun via military intervention and a sellout within. The references to the birds, probably mynas or macaws in a tropical setting, screeching this admonition occurs throughout the plot and usually occurs as part of spiritual exhortations. But it was this final exhortation that woke me up at the end of the book, at the culmination of the final chapter which is one of the most beautifully written conclusions I have ever read. It was as if Huxley was saying to the reader \"wake up!!!\" before our own personal island, i.e. ourselves, our souls, our identities, etc. are overtaken by a ravenous and consuming outside world.This is what I take Island to really mean: as a metaphor for the person as individual. We each are islands in the vast ocean of life; we should take very good care of ourselves and intentionally preserve and enhance our freedom, morality, spirituality and our autonomy lest we be consumed and overrun, a la Pala, by an uncaring, spirituality bankrupt and pillaging world without. Some reviews have suggested Pala as Huxley's depiction of a utopia counterposed against Brave New World. That is all well and good but, in the end, the utopia of Pala doesn't make it either. I believe Huxley was too cynical and suspicious of modern life to ever suspect a utopia could long survive en masse. What he did promote, in various forms of expression, was a profound concern for individual freedom in a world populated by tyranny, totalitarian forces in varous shapes and mass market commercialism collectively sucking all the vitality and beauty out of human existence.Huxley was a great humanist and proponent of extending human freedom and potential wherever possible and combating any force arrayed against that effort. He early on experimented with drugs as a means, I believe, of expanding human experience and expression. In many respects he was the precursor to Timothy Leary and the LSD movement, the hippie generation, the New Agers, the green movement in general and other groups concerned with the human condition arrayed against tyranny, dogmatism and capitalism run amok. Island is the literary culmination of his lifelong work and is a profound, astute and deeply mystical book. Easily one of the best I have ever read.It is little noted that Huxley, prior to his serious writing career and Brave New World, once taught French to English schoolboys. One of his students was none other than Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, the future author of 1984. It is one of the great ironies of modern life that one English classroom could have housed at one time the two great geniuses of the twentieth century, in terms of political satire, whose combined dystopias portrayed a future world so nightmarish and inhumane that it jolted humankind into thought and action, providing inestible service. Did Huxley inspire Orwell in his thought at that early stage or with Brave New World later? Who knows, nonetheless Huxley was a magnificent thinker and profoundly influential figure of the twentieth century. His Island, equal to Brave New World in my opinion, fittingly crowns his eventful life prior to his death a year later.Other reviewers have more than adequately summarized the plot. For me, the talking birds say it all.",

Als een van de weinigen overleefde hij die hel en keerde hij terug en schreef, aanvankelijk uit een chaotische, blinde drang, Is dit een mens.

She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others. She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: \"The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone.\" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty. Lanterns is illustrated with thirty of the author's personal photographs and includes \"A Parent's Pledge\" and \"Twenty-five More Lessons for Life,\" an inspiration to all of us-parents, grandparents, teachers, religious and civic leaders-to guide, protect, and love our children every day so that they will become, in Marian Wright Edelman's moving vision, the healing agents for national transformation.",

Edleman talks about the importance of parents, community elders as co-parents and mentors, and the powerful role teachers can play in the development of character. Her college years were greatly influenced by the civil rights leaders of the time, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Robert Kennedy among others. Edelman shares lessons learned from influential faculty and family friends and helps readers understand what it is like to be a part of something larger than themselves.This book, which focuses on the powerful influence that mentors can have on children and young adults, finishes with Edelman's \"Parent's Pledge\" and \"Twenty-Five More Lessons for Life\". She shares the wisdom gained from her parents and elders as well as her many years of experience working with children. Pearls such as \"Always remember you are God's child. No man or woman can look down on you and you cannot look down on any man or woman or child\" and \"Keep your word and your commitments\" provide valuable advice for those seeking a strong moral center. This book is a recommended read for anyone interested in life lessons learned from a woman of faith whose experiences have been enriched by her interactions with the mentors in her life.",

      "description": "An extremely moving account of the lonely life of the unloved and tragic genius - described as \"the greatest modern Italian poet\" 'Love me, by God; I need love, love, love, fire, enthusiasm, life. The world does not seem made for me' Giacomo Leopardi, considered the greatest Italian poet since Dante, was one of the most radical thinkers of the nineteenth century. He also regarded himself one of the most miserable and unfortunate people to have lived. Born to strict parents in a provincial town in 1798, he had a lonely childhood, and he spent his time largely in his father's library. He suffered from a debilitating illness, and his short life was full of pain. But this pain and misery gave rise to some of the most intense and brilliant poems ever written in the Italian language. In this poetic biography, Iris Origo, author of the bestselling War in Val d'Orcia traces the short and lonely life of this conflicted poet. Written with generosity and understanding, A Study in Solitude is a sharp, moving portrait of a frail and frustrated genius. Iris Origo (1902-1988) was a British-born biographer and writer. She lived in Italy and devoted much of her life to the improvement of the Tuscan estate at La Foce, which she purchased with her husband in the 1920s. During WWII, she sheltered refugee children and assisted many escaped Allied prisoners of war and partisans in defiance of Italy's fascist regime and Nazi occupation forces. Pushkin Press also publishes her war diaries, War in Val d'Orcia, her memoir, Images and Shadows, as well as another of her biographies, The Last Attachment.",

      "author": "Thomas Paine",
      "rate": "4.6/5",
      "description": "Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",

      "rate": "2.0/5",
      "description": "Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996, a big volume collecting all his shorter writings organized by subject. The themes he chose reflected his lifelong concerns: war, history, law, class, means and ends, and race. Throughout his life Zinn had returned again and again to these subjects, continually probing and questioning yet rarely reversing his convictions or the vision that informed them. The result was The Zinn Reader. Five years later, starting with Howard Zinn on History, updated editions of sections of that mammoth tome were published in inexpensive stand-alone editions. This second edition of Howard Zinn on History brings together twenty-seven short writings on activism, electoral politics, the Holocaust, Marxism, the Iraq War, and the role of the historian, as well as portraits of Eugene Debs, John Reed, and Jack London, effectively showing how Zinn’s approach to history evolved over nearly half a century, and at the same time sharing his fundamental thinking that social movements—people getting together for peace and social justice—can change the course of history. That core belief never changed. Chosen by Zinn himself as the shorter writings on history he believed to have enduring value—originally appearing in newspapers like the Boston Globe or the New York Times; in magazines like Z, the New Left, the Progressive, or the Nation; or in his book Failure to Quit—these essays appear here as examples of the kind of passionate engagement he believed all historians, and indeed all citizens of whatever profession, need to have, standing in sharp contrast to the notion of \"objective\" or \"neutral\" history espoused by some. \"It is time that we scholars begin to earn our keep in this world,\" he writes in \"The Uses of Scholarship.\" And in \"Freedom Schools,\" about his experiences teaching in Mississippi during the remarkable \"Freedom Summer\" of 1964, he adds: \"Education can, and should, be dangerous.\"",

He saw the baby boom part of the twentieth century history evolve before his eyes with major events, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the further activism that occurred thereafter, and the effects of the war on Vietnam with archival work, to name a few. HOWARD ZINN ON HISTORY is a collection of essays and articles previously published in notable journals and magazines, such as the Midwestern Archivist and Saturday Review. Zinn examines topics that have affected him academically as well as personally, and appear somewhat out dated but timeless at the same time because of how much has progressed from the time he originally wrote the pieces.The book may serve as a teaching tool for a political or American history classes because of its small format. It is the type of book that will raise questions for the casual history reader as well as the any history major. However, there are serious political overtones that resonate with the majority of the essays that may suggest Zinn's revisionist perspective on history, but he exposes the study of history and the sum of its parts. Zinn states: \"The scholar may swear to his neutrality on the job, but whether he be physicist, historian, or archivist, his work will tend, in this theory, to maintain the existing social order by perpetuating its values, by legitimizing its priorities, by justifying its wars, perpetuating its prejudices, contributing to its xenophobia, and apologizing for its class order\" (p. 167).Zinn opens the door to history as well as an inquiry into how it is shaped and formed. He probes important topics that have often been overlooked, which raises important questions, what can be considered history, and how long does it take to be history?",

I'm not sure what the reviewer defines as funny, but after reading travelogues by Bill Bryson and Peter Mayle (which have their share of funny moments) this is a much more scholarly tome. Some of these outposts are in the middle of nowhere and you wonder how people live.I think the chapter I most enjoyed was Gibraltar - only because I know all about the roundabout trip British citizens have to make from getting from Spain to The Rock. (Okay - maybe that was the funny section.) My second favourite section was the Falklands (or should I say Malvinas?) -- I vaguely remember the war and it was nice to get a history lesson from this book. I'm sure my friends in the UK know more about this conflict that I do - but I don't remember a lot of news coverage here in the USA. (Granted, it's 20 years ago, but still - if it's not affecting the USA, the news kind of just skates over it quickly, if it's mentioned at all.)It's fine writing, makes you think about places that you might never otherwise heard of, but at times it's dull and reads more like a history text than a travelogue.",

A century ago the Empire spanned the globe, hundreds of islands, dozens of countries and protectorates and the sun truly never set on the territories. But the Empire shrunk and collapsed in on itself yet straggling islands across the planet still lay claim or are claimed by the shadow of day's long gone.Sure, as other people have said, it's a dated book. But it was written in 1985 and reading it with that in mind it's a fascinating travelogue. I loved the author's attempt to \"invade\" Diego Garcia accompanied by the disappointing story of how residents were evicted and the U.S. put in a major (nuclear) base. The empire has done so many things in its best interest, unfortunately that doesn't always include protecting individual rights.I also learned a lot about St. Helena where exiles resided for decades (Napoleon, Mbelini - head of the Zulu Nation). I knew nothing about the beauty of the island or of the mansion where Napoleon took his walks and dictated his memoirs, staff on hand and British Guards out of sight.The Pitcairn islands are the last refuge of Britain in the Pacific not even administered nearby, but instead thousands of miles away from Australia. The resident population shrinking and forgotten. The average British citizen doesn't know much about its current empire. Maybe if you ask they'll say the Isle of Mann or the Faulklands. But these Outposts are historic and present. It's a great read. I love learning the minutia of history: the forgotten places, the discarded histories, and the neglected peoples.Dated? Maybe, but is history ever dated and does travel lose its romance.- CV Rick, March 2008",

And we are lucky to be allowed a peek into the workings (or no workings) of the British colonies. I was born and bred in Karachi and I can attest to the many goods and bads which were left by British empire. The railways remain their biggest contribution to Pakistan, as far as I can see. And they left those high handed bureaucrats, who were supposed to be good but have turned out badly. British gave us a certain system but they also destroyed and help eliminate many of the hand made products including hand made silk linen, which was the best in the world and was produced in Bengal region. To promote their own merchandise and machinery, British banned the making of this wonderful fabric, whose 7 yards could be packed within a cigarette packet.The most unfortunate legacy of British empire in Subcontinent (Pakistan, Bengal, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma) is the profusion of religious madrassahas (schools of Islamic law and jurisprudence) which created multiple religious thought processes including the violent ideology of Deobandi school. They were actively supported by British over-lords and we can see the results today: From Afghanistan to Pakistan and beyond the entire region is engulfed in the religious hatred flames.Back to the book: It is wonderfully written and he gets his facts straight.",

Remnick manages to convey the views of the liberals who want to democratize the country and the neo-Stalinist conservatives who want to turn the clock back to the repression of life under Stalin.The author has little sympathy for Mikhail Gorbachev who once he launched \"perestroika\" could not make the final commitment to democracy and republicanism and remained trapped in the dying and corrupt Communist Party. Yet, Gorbachev's half-hearted attempts at reform nearly ended in a disasterous rigt-wing coup. Only, the incompetence of the plotters and will of the people not to turn back to a corrupt failed system prevented the USSR in falling back into despotism.Because of \"glasnost and perestroika\" Remnick was able to obtain candid views from everyone he interviewed during his stay in the Soviet Union. Miners, dissident and even communist party apparatchiks spoke freely about the good and bad of Russia. Nearly, 50 years after his death, Stalin's shadow still hovered over everything and everyone in the nation. Liberals such as Andrei Sakharov wanted the government and the party to fully acknowledge the heinous attrocities of mass murder and imprisonments committed during Stalin's reign, Khrukhschev made a tentative start at 20th party congress in denouncing Stalin but failed to follow through with real reform. During the Brezhnev years the country lurched backwards thast by the time Gorbachev came to power the Soviet Union was totally morally, politically and economically bankrupt.Remnick also does a fine job showing the first hesitant steps toward capitalism yet evenn today 10 years after the Soviet Union collapsed Russia still refuses to make the fundamental changes to bring a market economy fully to fruition. Under the Communists there was \"equity in poverty\" today in Russia you see the extremes of rich and poor. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the demise of the Soviet Union, but it needs an update to encompass the last decade.",

As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup', KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents, I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President, who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service, at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6, and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets, which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria, I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff, and his book does so nicely.",

Hayward description of events clearly indicates that the German 1942 campaign would have been successful if the German leadership (from the General Staff on up) had created operational focus and maintained it throughout the campaign.The lesson for us today is that, in our age of limited resources, failure to followthrough and focus our resources on the important goals, in the order that those goals must be achieved is the most important requirement for success.I would recommend this, not just to history buffs, but to business leaders of all types.",

          "comment": "This is one of the very best book on the Luftwaffe by serious, academic historian, and possibly the only one to date to give credit and recognition to one of the best tactical minds of he Luftwaffe, GFM von Richtofen.While justifiably lambasting the Luftwaffe (and Hitler too) on its short sightedness in forgoing the development of a strategic, heavy bomber in favour of tactical, short range fighters and light payload bombers, Hayward does remind us the indispensable role of the Luftwaffe as the Heer's flying artillery and its role in her battlefield successes.The fact that the Luftwaffe was staffed mainly by transferees from the Heer may be a determining factor in shaping its mission as a tactical, close support airforce, and its reluctance to develop, acqueisce or sustain a naval air arm for the tonnage battle in the Atlantic (same can be said of Raeder's and D&ouml;nitz's strategic shortcomings, both concentrating on their respective favourites, battleships and U-boats, while paying little heed to the crucial role of air cover for naval actions) may stem from the tradtional rivalry during the Kaiser's times between the senior service, Army and the Kaiser's favourite, the Kriegsmarine, which in the Great War proved to be a less than war winning tool, and a dtermining factor (with her mutinies) in the dissolution of the Reich.It is amazing that nobody in the top echelons of the Luftwaffe had articulated a strategic vision for the role of the service in war. Same with the Krigesmarine with its focus and fetish on battleships and U boats.Bearing in mind that Germany was flanked by her traditional enemies in Europe, and the need for the avoidance of the nightmarish 2 front war like the last war, which stretched Germany to her limits as a middling power battling the superpowers (Britain, Russia and USA), the much vaunted General Staff as well as OKW, OKH. OKM. OKL had not seen the need for a strategic airforce of long range fighters and high altitude heavy bombers (plus aircraft carriers for the inevitable last fight with the US after mastery of Europe) that will serve as a deterrent in any enforced peace with Britain and USSR, or as an indisepnsable deep penetrating tool for crippling her enemies' military-political-industrial complexes, the cross-Channel invasion of Britain, the strangling of trans-Atlantic trade between Britian and her Dminions as well as her banker, the US.Inter-service rivalry will see the Luftwaffe refusing to build up a naval air arm, or let the Kriegamrine to have one, nor did the latter, with its uni-dimensional focus on the war at sea, see the need for aircover and aircraft carriers ( all because of the myopic expedient that for the same amount of steel, you can build 20 U boats in a shorter time) for her naval units. This led to the loss of aircover over her bases, and drove the U boats underwater (thus limiting her striking power as they fought on the surface!) and her surface units immobilised in hideouts in France and Norway.Without a strategic airforce, and with the loss of air supremacy at home and above the battelfields, Germany suffred from the vicious cycle of loss of aircover, then devastated industries, then even less aircrafts, arms and munitions to fight off her enemies on all fronts,and so on. In the end, the Luftwaffe was no more than the Heer's last mobile artiller and machine gun battalions (most of the Heer's artillery was horse drawn) and the Kreigsmarine an impotent coast guard.It would be interesting to see if, like the Generalstab, most of the Heer transferees were artillerists ( the most technical proficient branch and thus uniquely suited to the technically most demanding service), who with their mindset would predisposed them to a tactical, close support vision of the Luftwaffe",

      "author": "Andrea Sutcliffe",
      "rate": "1.7/5",
      "description": "In 1807, Robert Fulton, using an English mail-order steam engine, chugged four miles an hour up the Hudson River, passing into popular folklore as the inventor of the steamboat. However, the true first passenger steamboat in America, and the world, was built from scratch, and plied the Delaware River in 1790, almost two decades earlier. Its inventor, John Fitch, never attained Fulton's riches, and was rewarded with ridicule and poverty. Considering there was not a single working steam engine in America in the early 1780s, Fitch's steamboat's development was nothing short of remarkable. But he faced competition from the start, and he and several other inventors fought a string of bitter battles, legal and otherwise. Steam tells the dramatic story of Fitch and his adversaries, weaving their lives into a fascinating tale including the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. It is the story behind America's first important venture in technology, the persevering and colorful men that made it happen, and the great invention that moved a new nation westward.",

His achievements were great, but only because a bunch of inventors went before him. He too stood on the shoulders of giants, he just didn't admit it.Andrea Sutcliffe has done a good job here of pulling together the history of the development of steam powered vessels in the United States.She mentions that Henry Miller Shreve (after whom Shreveport, Louisiana was named) built some steam boats. I tend to say that the thing Robert Fulton built was really a steam ship, that is a deep draft vessel, suitable for use in deep rivers like you find in the Northeast. Shreve invented (along with some help of course) the typical Mississippi River Steamboat.This is probably not important, but when we think of the early boats, we tend to think of riverboats on the Mississippi not the early boats on the Hudson.Recommended book.",

Alas, not only is that answer wrong; but a correct one cannot be summed up by just one name, one year, or one event. Andrea Sutcliffe unravels the tangled web of men, machines, failures, successes, financial backers, patents and politics involved in getting steamships chugging on American rivers during the time period of 1784 to 1811. Here we learn about people like John Fitch and James Rumsey. We discover how George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were involved in the process. We read about boiler explosions, innumerable tinkerings and improvements, and proving \"who had what idea when.\" The newly-formed Patent Office plays a huge role in this drama. Robert Fulton doesn't even make an appearance until the last third of the book. Throughout it all, one has to wonder about the tenacity and sanity of the men who not only had to deal with the temperament of machines, but also with the skepticism of state and federal authorities. Imagine attempting to take a prototype steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers during the New Madrid earthquake of 1811! Why didn't we ever hear about these stories in school? As for Robert Fulton: \"As Fulton freely admitted, he never really invented the steamboat. Rather, he built the first steamboat that really worked.\" (p. 180) And he comes off as a dandy and an opportunist in this book.You might scoff and ask, \"How interesting can the history of the steamboat be?\" Read this book and find out. The miracle is that this invention ever came to fruition.",

Showalter's research is thorough, and her presentation of information shows a care and attentiveness to her material that increases the confidence of the reader. Drawing on a cultural sangria of material, The Female Malady traces the systematic (and often blundering) treatment of mental disease, focusing on how women influenced the establishment as not only patients, but commentators in the form of employees and writers, activists and advocates.The majority of the text focuses on the plight of the Victorian woman, and how doctors and the medical profession responded to what they perceived as the nervous energy attached to the rising discontent of women as a gendered class. However, the text does not end there, and moves on to discuss everything from evolving practices in institutions, the feminization of mental disease, the presence and treatment of male patients, psychoanalysis, and the feminist therapy movement. Showalter skillfully blends historical observation and study with careful literary analysis to give her reader and understanding of the material from several angles and increase their awareness of the historical implications of insanity not just for the evolution of women, but for the sciences and literary fields alike. At just 250 pages, The Female Malady is by no means a complete history, but proves to be a useful volume on its own, especially for those considering cultural and literary implications of insanity beyond the straight-forward studies of psychology or psychoanalytic theory.",

At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book \"Aerobics\" (a term he coined), then to \"Aerobics Program for total Well Being...\", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book \"Start Strong, Finish Strong\" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary.

Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas.

          "comment": "The problem with most diabetic care is that is is advocated by healthcare professionals who have no personal experiental knowledge of the disease from living with it and managing it on a daily round the clock basis through ordinary events of daily living as well as crisis situations and travel. Dr. Bernstein has been a diabetic since the age of 12 and has experienced the ravages of the disease on the body and through his inquisitve and engineering background has applied these principles in his quest to normalize his own blood sugars. From buying the first glucose monitor for personal useage and through trial and error developing a diabetic management protocol, he learned how to normalize his own blood sugars and that there could be reversal of many of the adverse effects of the disease provided they had not reached the point of irreveribility. He went on to medical school when many of his writings were not accepted by the medical community. He has been actively treating diabetics from around the world helping them to normalize their blood sugars by putting into practice the library of his knowledge and practical solutions that will not only normalize anyone's blood glucose if they heed his instructions but will also help prevent if nor reverse some or many of the potential complications. I personally have been a diabetic for a number of years and even employed an insulin pump for several years. I have had extensive diabetic counselling but still failed to maintain what I considered to be an oxymoron, i.e. control of my disease. I became very frustrated and was really on the verge of giving up. I realized that things like dialysis, stroke and heart problems were approaching unless I could do something. I had already developed significant peripheral neuropathy. When I discovered his books, I read them and applied what he said and began experiencing immediatiate improvement on a consistent predictable basis. I have personally been treated by Dr. Bernstein but if you can't see him personally in addtion to reading and folowing his book then BUY THE BOOK and religiously follow it. If you have been a diabetic for years, you will have the necessary experience to understand and make the corrections with the help of your personal physician. If you are a newly diagnosed diabetic, this will give you the opportunity to prevent many or all of the mistakes and frustrations of managing this disease and its serious complications. DR. BERNSTEIN'S METHODS WORK! IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THEM, YOU ONLY HAVE YOURSELF TO BLAME!",

          "comment": "This is the third book by Dr. Bernstein that I have read and it's seems impossible but each one of his books has more and more to offer. If you have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, you absolutely must read this book.I read the first edition, about 6 years ago. It saved my husband's life. My husband is a type 2 diabetic. After seeing his doctor faithfully every 3 to 6 months for 20 years and taking his medications, he became more and more ill. He was at a point of taking 43 units of insulin a night, could hardly walk more than 75 or 100 feet, weighed 270 pounds, his Hemoglobin A1c was 11, he was always tired out, depressed and hell to live with.After reading Dr. Bernstein's book, I knew that my husband could be helped. I put him on a program of low carb and exercise and the results were nothing short of a miracle. He has been off (completely off!) of insulin for over 3 years, he walks 2 miles at the local gym every day, has energy to burn and has lost 80 pounds! His HA1c is 6.5. Best of all he is back to being himself. He is happy again and so am I. We are going into our 5th year of low carb lifestyle and exercise daily. Something I never would have dreamed of doing before reading Dr. Bernstein's book.Dr. Bernstein is one of the voices in the wilderness. His book clearly explains what you need to do to overcome this disease and he should know - he has been a Type 1 diabetic since the age of 12 years old.Dr. Bernstein was an engineer in his earlier years. He approached diabetes through the eyes of an engineer, working the problem until he came up with a solution. The medical profession would not listen to him (and why would they - when they get a diabetic patient, they and the pharmaceutical companies have a patient for life!). When he was 45 years old, he went back to school and became a physician!The American Diabetes Association recommends a diet of 60% carbohydrates!!!! That is absolutely wrong! Dr. Bernstein can explain it to you. Read this book. Save your life or the life of someone you love.I would give this book 10 stars if that rating was available to me.",

          "comment": "Dr. Bernstein is a truly remarkable man - he is both brilliant and really cares about diabetics (unlike some other authors I have read who seem more interested in promoting their own agenda). I know there are things he'd rather be doing at this point, but he continues to try to get information and help out to the rest of us, despite being treated quite poorly by much of the medical community, even as they gradually work their way to saying what he's been saying all along.Dr. B may be the oldest living (74 yrs old) Type I diabetic; he essentially cured himself of a number of severe diabetic complications (severe kidney disease among others) by experimenting on himself and learning how to keep his blood sugars constantly in the normal range. He believes that diabetics are entitled to the same blood sugars non-diabetics have. This is uncommon in the medical community, most of whom advocate target blood sugars for diabetics that are well above normal - and I guess they think we should just accept these high levels and the complications that flow from them.Since I discovered Dr. Bernstein, I've read his book and have also been listening to the Teleseminars he gives, for free, once a month, to answer questions people have ([...] - but please, read the book first - people who ask questions answered in the book will not be appreciated). I have learned a phenomenal amount.Anyway, about the book. It starts w/Dr. Bernstein's personal story, which is amazing but also a good way of introducing the basic approach he has come to and the rationale behind it.Exercise:Dr. Bernstein is a huge advocate of exercise for diabetics (especially Type II w/insulin resistance), and he discusses what he considers to be the best type of exercise for improving insulin sensitivity and reversing cardiovascular complications. He himself has a body-fat percentage of seven and (I've seen him in video) has amazing muscle tone for a man of any age, much less a diabetic man in his 70s.Diet:Dr. Bernstein also advocates a very low carbohydrate diet*, and the rationale is sound.a. For Type IIs, carbs are of course the source of glucose, and eating them forces whatever pancreatic beta cells you have left to wear themselves out producing insulin to cover what you ate. And, more than likely, if you're a Type II, you are insulin resistant which means you need to produce much more insulin than a normal person would to cover your carb intake. So, keeping carbs to a minimun gives your pancreas a break and may let you recover some (but probably not all) of the beta cells you've lost to overwork and glucose-related damage.b. For Type Is or insulin-dependent Type IIs, trying to accurately estimate how much insulin you need if you are eating a high carbohydrate meal is virtually impossible. Apparently, food manufacturers are allowed to be up to 20% off in their estimates of nutrient content. So, if you think you are eating a 100 g carb meal, you could be eating only 80g, in which case you've taken too much insulin and could have a hypoglycemic reaction, or you could be eating 120g, in which case your blood sugar will be too high.Medication:Because he is committed to the idea that diabetics are entitled to fully normal blood sugars (which he estimates to be 83 plus or minus 2), he readily advocates medications, up to and including insulin, if diet and exercise have not be enough to get blood sugars to normal levels. And again, the rationale is there. Most importantly, by the time you get fasting blood sugars in the pre-diabetic or diabetic range, you've lost a large percentage of your pancreatic beta cell function. [Why docs don't routinely do post-prandial blood sugars and/or Hemoglobin A1C screening is a mystery to me - if they did, many of us would have been in a position to prevent this damage much earlier.] In any case, you can give your pancreas a rest and allow your not-yet-dead beta cells to recover by a) reducing insulin resistance (with Insulin Sensitizing agents) and/or b) providing an external source of insulin (injecting) so that your pancreas doesn't have to do the work.Dr. B. discusses the various medications available, how they work and why he does or does not use them. He also covers information that is only relevant to people on insulin, but it is very interesting, and the practical details he covers really gives you a sense that this is someone who deals with diabetes and diabetics every day.I would especially encourage medical professionals to read this book. We desperately need more medical professionals who understand these things. If you are a diabetic or pre-diabetic, read the book (I'd recommend reading it a couple times) and pass it on to your doctor.Hope this was helpful to someone.*I have been a huge carb eater all my life, but cutting them out has not been nearly as difficult as I would have imagined. Even if you read this and think \"I just couldn't do that,\" read the book anyway. Then decide.",

Over the years he has developed his own special way of keeping his blood sugar levels at appropriate levels, which managed to keep him healthy and from suffering many of the standard serious health problems associated with diabetes. He believes in arming patients with information to control their disease themselves. This book covers new oral medications, new insulins, and new dietary supplements. Bernstein's views differ from the American Diabetes Association, particularly in his recommendation of a low carbohydrate diet, avoidance of certain types of oral medications, and using nutrients to lower insulin resistance.This very complete book includes some patient stories, chapters on the basics, tests, how and when to measure blood sugar, treatments, diet, weight loss, exercise, insulin information, and recipes. There is an excellent glossary and an index, in addition to useful appendices. Well written and easy to understand, it is over 500 pages of useful information.Some important and surprising statistics:-- 25% of Americans between age 65 and 74 are Type 2 diabetics.-- One in three babies born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes during their lifetimes.-- Every day 1,400 people are diagnosed with diabetes.-- It is third leading cause of death (and contributes to high blood pressure, heart disease, infections, that also are factors in deaths).Armchair Interviews says: It is very important to know about this disease.",

Healthcare here is a privilege, not a right and as such patients are now \"customers\". I am amazed at the number of physicians that are coming into practice that have the \"monkey see, monkey do\" attitude. Many shuffle patients through their offices like cattle in a chute as they have to see a certain amount to make the money. When you are in their office they just want to write a script for the latest pill and send you on your way. This results in very little time for a quality health assessment and advice. Dr. Bernstein's books ( I have ordered the Diabetes Solution and just finished the Diabetes Diet) are a 180 approach to treating diabetes. He answers the questions you have and those you did not know you had. He is a true scientist in every sense of the word.Through his amazing work, he tells people how to live a better, healthier life with diabetes. I am not diabetic...yet. I am having a problem with insulin resistance. I am 50, very overweight and for the last two years have craved sweets like a Heroin addict. While the diet is very restrictive to those carbs that will cause a quick rise in you blood sugar (bad for diabetics AND nondiabetics) I consider myself to be an addict and need to stop these types of foods to live a better life (and a longer one). If you see yourself in any of these reviews, please get a copy of the book....somehow, even if only at the library. It can save a life. Whether your diabetic or not, this is the lifestyle you should strive for. We must stop blindly following health advice when that advice has been proven detrimental to our health and well-being.Dr. Bernstein's books are the light at the end of your tunnel. Keep walking toward it and you will not be sorry.",

Having an A1c of 9.3 with lots of medication to getting an A1c of 7.2 three months later with minimum medication seems to work for me. Ofcourse the idea is low carb and moderation and I think is the only solution for the diabetics.I do have one comment for people writing giving bad reviews. I respect everyon's opinion but if a person is not a doctor and is not diabetic, pretty much they do not know what they are talking about and what a diabetic has to go through to fight this battle. They do not have the knowledge nor the experience. An ideal person to write a review would be a doctor who is suffering from diabetes. But this is just my opinion.thanks",

I had gained almost 50 pounds, and nothing seemed to be able to stop this slow trip to a death I did not want to think about. I was maxed out on meds, and my doctor's next step was \"just a little insulin\". There was no way I was going to let that happen, but what could I do with blood sugars bouncing around with highs of 250 or more and my fasting blood sugars that were in the high 180's? Thanks be to God for creating Dr. Bernstein. After three weeks of using the 6,12,12 carb diet, my blood sugars are now down in the 80's. They stay there even after I eat, which is the real blessing, as there is no spiking of blood sugars. Not only has that happened, but I am loosing weight. I no longer have gas and chest pains that are caused from gas. If you are a type I or II, this is really a Diabetes Solution. As I see it, its a painful death, or a rich healthy life.

I switched over to a caffeine-free coffee substitute made from soyabeans I found on the net at www.S o y c o f f e e.c om. It so easy for someone to tell you to eat less, but if you are craving bad foods, eventually you will fail. In the first five days I was on this diet all the craving ceased and I was already 8 lbs down.

Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation.",

      "description": "LeBron James is a six-foot-eight gift from the basketball heavens. For the past three years he was the undisputed finest high school player in America. He was the one NBA scouts drooled over, corporations dreamt of, event promoters begged for, and now NBA fans clamor after. With appearances on the cover of Sports Illustrated and features on ESPN and in newspapers across the country, never before has a high school basketball player been so highly touted or an eighteen-year-old athlete been the subject of such fascination. In fact, no basketball player in the world has had this level of attention this year. Love him or hate him, there is no denying that LeBron James is a force on the basketball court, and his rags-to riches story is the stuff that dreams are made of. Now, for the first time, author Ryan Jones has written a book that incorporates everything that is King James: the controversy, the athletic potential, the jerseys and the Humvee, the hobnobbing with the world's most famous stars, the money, and, of course, the game. This is a book for every fan of LeBron James and for anybody interested in reading about an NBA basketball career in the making.",

It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.",

Those of us who are Chicago White Sox fan see our team starting off even with every other time and hope abounding. What will the season hold? Only 162 games will tell us.This book is one of those compendia that come out each year, providing information on major league baseball players. This has a sabermetric element to it, so those who love statistics will enjoy this work.There are some nice features, including a listing of the top 100 prospects this season, how base running turns into runs, projected leaders in a variety of categories (e.g., they project Ryan Howard to lead in home runs with 44, Albert Pujols to lead in batting average with .327, Jose Reyes to lead in stolen bases with 60, etc.).Those projections are based on a technique called PECOTA, in which players are equated with many other players--past and present--with similar characteristics. Then, that data base is used to project how well the particular contemporary player is likely to do this year. As an example, let's take a look at one team, the White Sox. Many of the Sox' key players are aging, and projections suggest declining performance among such stalwarts as Jim Thome and A. J. Pierzynski. Paul Konerko and Jermaine Dye, on the other hand, are projected to perform in similar fashion to 2007. By the way, one of the nice features is that each player is compared to those whose career statistics define PECOTA. For instance, comparables to Joe Crede include Dave Roberts, Kevin Orie, Tim Wallach, and Tim Hulett. Just looking at comparables is fun! Jermaine Dye is equated with Dave Henderson, Joe Adcock, Jose Canseco, and Juan Gonzalez. Pretty good company (at least for statistics). Paul Konerko is compared with Kevin Millar, Gil Hodges, Jeff Conine, and Eric Karros. The mainstay of the pitching staff, Mark Buehrle, is linked to Ken Holtzman (the old Cubbie!), Greg Swindell, Jim Abbott, and Curt Simmons.Enough comparisons. Another statistic is called VORP, value over replacement player. This statistic is created by assuming that a particular player would be removed from the lineup and replaced by someone of proven quality (the details are too lengthy to be presented in a line or two). The resulting figures are then used to estimate players who will rise and who will decline this coming year. White Sox fans might want to shiver a bit. Mark Buehrle is one of the projected 15 players who will decline the most.A couple other figures to illustrate what the book provides. Jim Thome is expected to see his home run total decline from 35 to 29 and his RBIs from 96 to 79. If you're curious, by the way, his comparator players include Frank Thomas, Willie McCovey, Darrell Evans, and Cliff Johnson--some pretty good company!Anyhow, this is a book that will be a lot of fun for baseball fans. It's a good way to start preparing for the new baseball season!",

These guys are not always on the nose -- their obsession with positions is a bit limiting to my mind, for one thing -- but they're right a helluva lot more often than they're wrong, and they've already proven themselves prophetic in many instances (for example, the White Sox's migrating back to the middle of the pack and the Mets' collapse). Plus, they're good writers -- not only are their analyses far more cogent than most sportswriters (admittedly, not a difficult task, since most sportswriters, not to mention analysts, can't tell their rear ends from their elbows), but those analyses are great fun to read for aesthetic reasons.Anybody who really cares about the game will love this book.",

      "description": "From the author of The Long Season—considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time—comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant. With legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan’s first book, The Long Season, he not only entered the canon of great sports literature, but also redefined it when he returned two years later to write Pennant Race—his memoir of his days playing for the Cincinnati Reds and how the team went from not being taken seriously as a pennant contender to having a shot at the 1961 National League pennant. In Pennant Race, Brosnan—with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality—once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish—if cautious—optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. Pennant Race vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball’s most memorable eras. “Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.”—New Yorker",

Although if the NLers had paid attention to what was going on in the American League in 1961 they would have had a pretty good clue.That year in the AL, like most years then, the Yankees steamrolled their way to yet another AL Championship but this time with a historic home run race between Mantle and Maris as well as prodigious hitting by many of the other junior circuit clubs. But in 1961 the Al expanded to ten teams which meantat least two pitching staffs that were just a little below big league skilllevels. Which certainly must have helped all those sluggers hit those dingers.Meanwhile, back in the old fashioned NL, the Reds defeated last years World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates for the NL pennant and a shot at the powerful Yankees in the World Series. You can read all about it in Brosnan's 1961diary except for the World Series which was not included in in Pennant Race possibly because Mr.Brosnan wanted to end the book on a triumphant note. BTW, the Yankees won four out of five games against the Reds in the 1961 World Series.Pennant Race is perhaps the most entertaining sports book that I have ever read, there are several laugh out loud sections and it is extrememly interesting to hear Brosanan's on field contemporaries' reactions to his first book, The Long Season. Pennant Race, despite the fact that the 1961 World Series is not covered, is without a doubt one of the finest, pioneering sports books of our time.",

Addressing all the various occult(semantic definition of &quot;hidden &amp; rejected knowledge&quot;) routes via the shortcut of this Art Historian's scholarly mind, as a whole this work is one of the best and most easily approachable &quot;magic histories&quot; for those who have no previous knowledge concerning occultism except an undeniable interest and fascination with the mysterious and the spiritual.Kurt Seligmann is darkly fascinated and explores endlessly the multitude of historic beliefs concerning the study of the nature of evil... such as black magic, necromancy, Elizabethian era conjurers and their Enochian magic,primitive rites, evocations of the Cultus Satanus, Goetia Demonomania, et.al....as an example, early on he discusses Chaldean phliosophies in which: &quot;Evil was born from God's disturbing thoughts&quot;...I have long wondered if the proposed thoughts had to do specifically with humanity?...and this book will surely set the fire or fan the sulphurous flames of those burning to know more about all things occult.The book primarily deals with Western Esoteric Traditions, which, being a westerner, appeals to my insatiable explorative appetite in studying and discovering the divinity of humankind and the accorded propensity &amp; potentials of individual spiritual progress through Magick and the strengthening of divine will ; in comparison with more Eastern idealogies concerned with mystical enlightenment and the abolishing of the ego to attain Nirvana.In summation, Kurt Seligmann, as one of the last efforts of his exemplary artistic journey throughout the early 20th century avant-garde, has given the world a completely unbiased in-depth world history from a magical perspective, a genuine labor of love which will always retain its intimately artistic personality in contrast to the strict scholarly treatise of the newspaper skeptic variety; and although there are better, more developed and intrigueing accounts out there, none are at the moment so readily available and economic, nor so expressive, or conclusively compact as this. Finally, the book has over a hundred and fifty illustrations from alchemical treatise and magical grimoires which compliment his descriptive writing style.It is besides all this, another exclamation point punctuating the Surrealist movement. surrealyours, an occultist.",

We get to know the characters well enough, but in doing so, Bova stifles the pacing of his book. This would work great on the movie screen; there are some really original and exciting virtual &quot;games&quot; going on here. There aren't a lot of characters to like in this book, although Dan certainly goes through hell to best his lifetime friend, Jason. Dan's wife, Susan, is whiny and sometimes I wanted to slap her; the daughter is a typical little brat, and what Uncle Kyle wants to do to her is pretty sick.

Early on I greatly enjoyed this book and the occasional flashbacks into the characters pasts were quite interesting. I also realized as I was reading this book that there's not a whole lot of action and the book probably could have been trimmed by about 150 pages. But in the end, I feel as though I got led in circles. Who is the Inquisitor? Who does he represent? What about the foreign investors? What about Disney possibly buying out ParaReality? So many ideas are introduced and nothing comes of any of them. I'll give one of his other books a shot, but this was a bit of a disapointment. Good first 450 pages, though.",

That is what is also key to this work, it describes the true Love that is God and that I know is the essence of our full existence and the Ultimate Reality. It is the ocean that is God, and any love that we experience in this life is a glimpse of the ocean of love which is Oneness. And any beauty here on Earth is a reflection of the infinite ocean of beauty that is Oneness. Our goal is to reach that by transforming our inner shadows. Now you might wonder how that archetypal plane is related to reaching Oneness, and that is through the other side of this book: dreamwork. Usually in describing monism and reaching God through the higher levels of reality, dreams are thought of as lower levels than what we experience now. But this author interprets them in light of our Self, which is One with realization of God. I must say that while reading this I felt more deeply suspended into that mystic Oneness.",

      "rate": "3.7/5",
      "description": "'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.",

          "comment": "The world still awaits a truly comprehensive history of Neopaganism. Margo Adler's estimable DRAWING DOWN THE MOON is perhaps the closest approach to date. With THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON, British historian Ronald Hutton has raised the bar for future efforts both in terms of depth of research and genuine insight. Though his book focuses on the antecedents and development of British Wicca, it contains a wealth of material to any reader interested in Neopaganism.Hutton is something of a bte noire for many Wiccans and other Neopagans after his iconoclastic PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES, particularly for his corrosive attacks on Robert Graves and THE WHITE GODDESS (however deserved they may have been). Hutton's work is, nevertheless, grounded in substantial research (as befits a widely-published historian) and a generally non-judgmental tone. Hutton continues his no-stone-unturned approach in this new book, but departs from simple history to offer rationales for the viability of Neopaganism as a religious path, even given its apparent twentieth-century origins.For many Neopagans outside of traditionalist Wicca, the book's focus on Neopagan Witchcraft (and in particular on Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders) may render its iconoclasm old news. Hutton's research only buttresses the deconstruction of Wicca begun in the '70s. Hutton's gift, though, is to go beyond the first order deconstruction and find unexpected bits of information amidst an impressive array of personal papers and museum holdings. For example, most informed readers will already be aware that &quot;Old&quot; Dorothy Clutterbuck, Gardner's supposed initiatrix, was shown to be a real person, after years of argument to the contrary. Hutton demonstrates, however--and rather conclusively to my mind--that &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; could not have been the person who initiated Gardner and he points emphatically to another woman who may have been hiding behind a smokescreen of Gardner's creation. Similarly, Hutton is not afraid to take on the now-taken-for-granted notion advanced by Aidan Kelly that the ritual nudity and scourging involved in Gardnerian Wicca were simply manifestations of Gardner's personal sexual kinks. Hutton ransacks Gardner's personal collection of pornography to refute this--and offers suggestions as to the real roots of these practices.The book is of greatest interest to the general (read, &quot;non-Wiccan&quot;) Neopagan reader in two regards. First, Hutton clearly demonstrates that the cultural roots of the Pagan revival lie embedded in the Romantic movement, particularly in Romantic Era poetry. The real forebears of the movement are seen to be, not Leland or Crowley (though both are examined and acknowledged), but poets like Keats, Shelley and Swinburne, who first identified the feminine divine with Nature and who repopularized the use of classical Pagan deities like Diana and Pan, often against critical resistance. The way in which Hutton tracks the passage of these motifs from literature into religion is fascinating.Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON represents a scholarly book by an apparently non-Pagan historian (unlike Adler) who is willing to see past the herd of sacred cows he is slaughtering to point out the transcendent values of Neopaganism--Wiccan or otherwise. He is careful throughout the book never to reach categorical judgements against some deeply-held beliefs, even where the evidence might strongly point in that direction. And, in the final pages of the book, Hutton sets aside the persona of the dispassionate researcher to advocate for pagan witchcraft as &quot;a full-blown, independent religion,&quot; one &quot;which deliberately draws upon ancient images and ideas for comtemporary needs,&quot; a protean faith which &quot;takes ideas from many sources and applies them in many--and often constantly altering--ways.&quot; Hutton hinted at this favorable sentiment in PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES and it is to his credit that he is willing to expand upon it here.Even speaking as an initiate in one of the traditions critically examined in the book (&quot;1734&quot; Witchcraft), I recommend it highly.",

It's a story of one man's journey from skeptic to the other side....by the end of the book, Keel is not necessarily a stone believer, but he is a stone paranoid, which amounts to the same thing. He goes into the book carrying one belief system and walks out of it with quite another.This, I feel, is the actual appeal of the book. We get to witness not the transformation of a character, but the transformation of the author, which makes this not only a fascinating study, but a dangerous book indeed.And why is it dangerous? Because a researcher changed his mind? No, it is dangerous because the researcher had CREDENTIALS beforehand...he's a scholar. If Gore Vidal (the historian) told you that in his research for \"Lincoln\" he discovered that Lincoln liked to savage rabbits with his bare hands...would you believe me?Of course not...but the problem here is that there is no historical record to go on, that if we are to believe, we believe on the basis of our judgment of a man's character.That said, I believe he is telling the truth. I have read not only the book in question, but many other works by Keel, and I believe him to be sane. Naive, yes, often. But always he thinks about his topic. This educated man experienced something back in 1967. The question is : should we accept his account of events?I personally say yes, but that is an answer rising from years of \"ufo's exist...\" upbringing, along with my religious convictions.I leave it up to you.The point is, this is a book that needs to be taken not with a grain of salt, but with a full salt lick in front of you. The facts presented are merely things to be looked at more carefully. Here's hoping you do just that. Highly recommended.",

Just because one cannot put a particular phenomenon under the rigours of scientific examination, doesn't mean such phenomenon is merely the product of a deranged mind. The reason the protectors of divine rationality are reluctant to examine the paranormal is it seems to contradict known physical laws. It doesn't follow the rules. However, if you have actually had the fortune or misfortune to experience such phenomenon i.e., spirits, UFO's, demonic creatures or source less cries of anguish in the night, ~The Mothman Prophecies~ can seem almost plausible. The book is certainly entertaining and, surprisingly, at times quite frightening.The book essentially focuses on a series of unexplained events that manifested in and around the little West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Numerous reports of Unidentified Flying Objects and strange lights in the southern skies motivated John Keel to investigate what all the fuss was about, and if there was any truth to the reports. His investigations led him down a peculiar path of events and personal experiences that finally pushed him to develop a theory, albeit an extrardinary one.What is the 'Mothman'? A journalist coined the term from the popular Batman series, because the actual creature, taken from eyewitness accounts, resembles the legendary comic hero. The amount of actual sightings is nothing less than incredible, which leads one to suspect the beast's reality. The book only touches on the Mothman and relates a scattered assortment of weird events and unusual sightings from the 'Men in Black' to 'abductions' and the cries of infants in the night. Throughout the book, Keel attempts to connect the dots, so to speak, inferring that all the varied phenomenon could well come from a single source. This is a big reach, but so is the book as a whole.Keel proposes that these manifestations, UFO's, MIB, winged-beasts et al, possibly originate from an alternate reality - another dimension if you will. These other dimensional being(s) guide and play with the human race and have been for a very long time. Throughout history these beings have manifested in many guises and forms, according to a specific historical/social context, depending on civilizations particular belief system at the time. For example, in the middle ages, this other dimensional phenomenon showed in the form of witches, warlocks, fairies and elves. For the American Indian, the phenomenon appeared as nature spirits; and in ancient times, they manifested as winged-lions, centaurs and Olympic gods. Because of our technological advancements and predilection to anything 'scientific', they now show as flying saucers, aliens and FBI agents. In other words, Keel suggests that their form shows in the way we 'interpret' these sightings - screened through our socially conditioned minds.Generally these amazing stories are told in a matter of fact tone, a journalistic style, setting the reader up from the start to lend credence to the entire book. This is clever and it works. But one gets the impression that Keel is absolutely serious about his subject matter - and to this day is trying to get to the bottom of it. This is what makes the book intriguing and worth the time.",

          "comment": "I have read over 200 books on UFOs and for many reasons, this is my favorite. Keel is an honest investigator who was fortunate to be involved in the strange, spooky events he writes about. Taken along with his first book, Operation Trojan Horse, this slim volume says more about the true nature of the UFO phenomenon than almost any other book written since. I was initially doubtful of the validity of Keel's claims, as some other reviewers are. However, I had the luck of meeting a man mentioned in the book who accompanied Keel on his investigations. This person, whom I trust and sincerely believe to be honest, flatly stated that everything in the book was true, that he had been there, spoke to the witnesses, and eventually became involved in the phenomena, as did Keel. The fact is, these things happened. In fact, Keel left some of the strangest evidence out of the book. Mothman Prophecies is a fascinating true story, and I recommend it to anyone who has a real desire to know the truth about UFOs and the paranormal.",

The movie is not even close to the greatness of the book. Mothman was actually called mothman off of a villain's name on Batman. In the book, the couple who answered the door for John Keel (John Klein in the movie) died in the Silver Bridge Tragedy.There are many interesting facts in The Mothman Prophecies.I think that this is a good book for Ufology fans.I very strongly disagree with anyone who gives this book a low rating.If you want to learn about MIB's,UFO's,Mothman,strange creatures, and Tulpas (mind projections), this is a good book to teach you all about these areas.",

A recap of events that took place in West Virginia during a thirteen month time period in 1966 and 1967. Some of the topics covered are strange creatures, UFO's, men-in-black, and prophetic events.If you are interested in these topics then be prepared to enjoy a few evenings reading some detailed accounts of what happened to some small-town folks who were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been in the right place at the right time. In most instances the author gives a good description of what happened, where it happened, and to whom. These are details that are often omitted in stories of the same type. There are also some good accounts of men-in-black that go beyond the characters in the movie of the same name. You'll want to read the accounts of this aspect of UFO lore.If you are a UFO buff, Ufologist, or self-styled field investigator, then be prepared to be insulted. The author makes no bones about giving little credence or respect to these types of people. Presumably he and a handful of others of the same ilk are the only credible authors. A dichotomy since these are the most likely kind of people to read his book.My only disappointment in the book is that there is not enough cohesiveness to the information. The events written about seem to come together only because they occurred at the same time in the same place.",

          "comment": "Never mind the nattering naybobs of negativity, this book is a classic. Why does Keel go into so many other subjects? Because the Mothman case he worked on was not an isolated &quot;monster&quot; invasion but an outbreak of various strange phenomena that had at its center recorded sightings of an unidentified winged creature dubbed the &quot;mothman.&quot; These sightings were part of a larger picture. Keel tells a complicated tale that requires some intelligence and imagination to understand. Without his various sidetrips there is no connection with the bridge collapse and hence no story or drama other than the individual encounters with the apparition. The movie was good but it dramatized the actual events for the sake of making a more cohesive story, just as all other movies based on books do. Take any book based on historical events and make a fiction film out of it and you'll find that certain distoritions must occur. You can't go back and blame history just because it isn't as thrilling and manipulated as fiction.",

I disagree with some of Keel's conclusions, at least with respect to them being the final word in what is obviously an ongoing puzzle, but he points to some very interesting possibilities. His notions are well worth adding to the soup of the still bubbling mystery that such bizarre experiences as Mothman, MIBs, strange aerial lights, odd electrical and poltergeist effects, etc., represent.That much if not all of what is reported is Earth-related does not lessen the difficulty of asserting categorically that &quot;extradimensional&quot; beings are entirely localized. The possibility of worlds without end lie that way, whether connected by wormholes or whatever in this dimension or in other layers outside of this one. I'd bet John a bottle of HERRADURA SELECCION SUPREMA tequila that our multilayered universe is full of life in many forms, mostly unexpected, and that this will become obvious far sooner than later (in the next hundred years at least).-- Randy",

If you will accept an explaination for parnormal events, presented in a matter of fact form, as truth, without further explaination as to how such conclusions are reached, then you will accept, probably love, this book. However, for me, a reasonable person, wishing for education, not blanket belief, this book is nothing more than a waste of money. I would gladly send you, dear reader, this book for free, saving you the cost of purchase, but the shipping fee is too great a cost, considering that I may use the book for fuel for a fire to warm me on a cold winters night...It reminds me of the great words of Eric Cartman: &quot;Well, they took me up in their spaceship, and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye&quot;.

For about the first 100 pages the author pretty much lists interviews and 1st hand accounts with contactees and their experiences. Though, after the 100th page or so (I don't know what it is about the 100th page for me), the book gets really interesting. Things start happening personally to John Keel himself. It seems as though, the more he begins to find out, and the deeper he goes into things, the more things begin to get in his way and stop him. It becomes apparent that someone or something doesn't want him to know what he knows.. Yet he persists. A very good book which lives up to its name.",

Unfortunately, I found the book somewhat disappointing.The premise of Mothman Prophecies is interesting but the actual execution of the book doesn't live up to the promise of the subject matter. Keel tries to include too much information and too many diverse happenings. While everything in the book contributes to the premise - that strange things did indeed happen in West Virginia one year in the mid-sixties - he never really focuses on any one aspect. Mothmen are one of many phenomena he describes. And while he gives a great deal of background on the many phenomena, he never really lets us know what he thought caused the upheaval that year. There are many case studies but very few conclusions as to the cases he encounters first-hand. And when he does cite previous studies or encounters, his sources seem a little shaky. Citing established sources is one thing but citing what I would think of as fringe publications causes me to question the validity of both his conclusions and the original source material. I do, however, understand that legitimate, well done research is produced by less established organizations and publications.While there are flaws, Keel does make the book enjoyable. It could be dry and lifeless but he injects a good sense of humor into his study keeping the reader engaged. And while you may believe nothing about what he claims happened, he does make a strong case for himself. Its hard to avoid admitting that something outside our collective realms of experience happened that year.",

      "description": "There is no other published book in English studying the constitution of the Roman Republic as a whole. Yet the Greek historian Polybius believed that the constitution was a fundamental cause of the exponential growth of Rome's empire. He regarded the Republic as unusual in two respects: first, because it functioned so well despite being a mix of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy; secondly, because the constitution was the product of natural evolution rather than the ideals of a lawgiver.Even if historians now seek more widely for the causes of Rome's rise to power, the importance and influence of her political institutions remains. The reasons for Rome's power are both complex, on account of the mix of elements, and flexible, inasmuch as they were not founded on written statutes but on unwritten traditions reinterpreted by successive generations. Knowledge of Rome's political institutions is essential both for ancient historians and for those who study the contribution of Rome to the republican tradition of political thought from the Middle Ages to the revolutions inspired by the Enlightenment.",

A dynamic, living product, food creates social bonds as it simultaneously marks off and maintains cultural difference. In bringing together anthropologists, historians and other scholars of food and heritage, this volume closely examines the ways in which the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of food is used to create identity claims of 'cultural heritage' on local, regional, national and international scales. Contributors explore a range of themes, including how food is used to mark insiders and outsiders within an ethnic group; how the same food's meanings change within a particular society based on class, gender or taste; and how traditions are 'invented' for the revitalization of a community during periods of cultural pressure. Featuring case studies from Europe, Asia and the Americas, this timely volume also addresses the complex processes of classifying, designating, and valorizing food as 'terroir,' 'slow food,' or as intangible cultural heritage through UNESCO. By effectively analyzing food and foodways through the perspectives of critical heritage studies, this collection productively brings two overlapping but frequently separate theoretical frameworks into conversation.",

Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting.

Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).",

I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend.",

Not even her farewell gift of a model medieval castle helps him feel better—though he has to admit it's fascinating. From the working drawbridge and portcullis to the fully-furnished rooms, it's perfect in every detail. It almost seems magical. And when William looks at the silver knight, the tiny figure comes to life in his hand—and tells him a tale of a wicked sorcerer, a vicious dragon, and a kingdom in need of a hero. Hoping the castle's magic will help him find a way to make his friend stay, William embarks on a daring quest with Sir Simon, the Silver Knight—but he will have to face his own doubts and regrets if he's going to succeed. William's story continues in The Battle for the Castle, available as a redesigned companion edition.

This is a true fantasy action book.The book starts out with William Lawrence age 10 who loves to do gymnastics. His Nanny, Mrs. Phillips, feels that it is time to return to her home in England. William does not want her to go and is trying to figure out a way to keep her with him. As part of her goodbye gift to him and a birthday gift, she gives him a castle that is very realistic but miniature. She hands him a small Silver Knight to use in the castle. William feels the knight move in his hand and thinks it is his imagination. However, it turns out that William broke the spell of an evil wizard, Alastor. The Silver Knight turns out to be a man named Sir Simon. His father was a King and Sir Simon was supposed to inherit the title after his father's death. However, Alastor got hold of the father and Sir Simon lost his inheritance. Alastor used a token to make Sir Simon turn to lead and shrinks him.William thinks of a plan to keep Mrs. Phillips with him. He uses the token to shrink Mrs. Phillips. Now, she is miserable being small in the castle. Sir Simon wants to return to his own land. William decides to go on the adventure with the Knight. In order to do this William has to have the courage to battle evil. He also has to show all the skill that he already possesses.It is truly a magical story and my kids cannot wait to read the sequel. It is definitely a must read. It was on my son's school reading list and I am glad it was!",

I won't tell you what he does because it would give away the ending. I think it is a good book because you want to know what happens. On a scale from one to five I would give it a four.This book was published in 1981 so its kind of old but still a good book.

I enjoyed this book and if you're an animal lover, you'll probably find a few scenes regarding them but it's not quite as good as her first two books in the series.Thea and Blaise are two cousins who have been expelled from five high schools because of Blaise's exploits. Unable to control her, Thea can only watch as Blaise toys with human boys and commands them to do her bidding.At their new school, things seem no different with Blaise setting her sights on Eric, a boy Thea is strangely attracted to. Amused by his refusal of Blaise, amusement soon turns to anxiety as Thea realises that her cousin is determined to make Eric desire her.Breaking the rule of never loving a human, Thea puts both her and Eric's life on the line as she tries to ward Blaise off.The two main characters (Blaise and Thea) are very well written and I could visualise them quite easily. They are both strong women and Blaise is not the complete ... that she seems to be. Nor is Thea the obedient, good girl she seems to be.Eric - and most human males in the series I must admit - is a bit of a weak character. When you really think about it, it's not that surprising. How can a weak human male compare to a cool, ruthless, strong vampire guy? He's not written in as much detail but you do get the general idea.There is a very good twist at the end and if you read carefully, you won't really guess it but you'll pick up small clues. Quite a bit of suspense and I liked the extra touch with the spirit.",

As with many of the colorful stories from the annuls of New York, The Lost Village of Central Park illustrates a very important chapter in the history of the city as well as the nation. Educational as well as entertaining. The fact that such a place existed more than 100 years ago proves that which makes us the same far outweighs that which makes us different. As former grade schoolteacher, I think this book should be on the shelves of every school and public library.",

If page one is an indication of the things to come, it's not good news for Harry. We see a seagull trying to break open a clam shell by dropping it on Harry's head. He gets caught in a storm and is stranded on an island with a lot of rocks, a scraggly tree, and an egg. As the egg hatches Harry figures it must be a bizzard, but comes to the realization that it's actually a dragon, a dragon that is continually eyeing Harry going \"Mmmmmmmmmmm\". The ending is a delightful twist and a valuable lesson is learned--there are fates far worse than death.Don't pass this book up.

This is as silly (and frustrating, and ultimately, discouraging) as giving a child a violin and telling him to express himself through music. We can be taught the fundamentals of drawing just as we can be taught the fundamentals of music, and while most of us will never achieve mastery or beauty, we can at least achieve proficiency, and have a new, lifelong skill.

      "description": "The information revolution--which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution--is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare, to terrorism, crime, and even radical social activism. The era of massed field armies is passing, because the new information and communications systems are increasing the lethality of quite small units that can call in deadly, precise missile fire almost anywhere, anytime. In social conflicts, the Internet and other media are greatly empowering individuals and small groups to influence the behavior of states. Whether in military or social conflicts, all protagonists will soon be developing new doctrines, strategies, and tactics for swarming their opponents--with weapons or words, as circumstances require. Preparing for conflict in such a world will require shifting to new forms of organization, particularly the versatile, hardy, all-channel network. This shift will prove difficult for states and professional militaries that remain bastions of hierarchy, bound to resist institutional redesign. They will make the shift as they realize that information and knowledge are becoming the key elements of power. This implies, among other things, that Mars, the old brute-force god of war, must give way to Athena, the well-armed goddess of wisdom. Accepting Athena as the patroness of this information age represents a first step not only for preparing for future conflicts, but also for preventing them.",

So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun!

She spoke at numerous patient's meetings, presented to groups of doctors, and fielded many, many questions from caregivers and patients concerning this disease.The book GrannyBarb wrote is an excellent overview of CLL. It includes an overview of the disease, symptoms, potential treatments, possible side effects, and what to expect when the disease progresses. It is very well written and covers more than the basics one might pick up from the Web. This is one strength of the book: it distills all that is known about the disease and covers ground that is probably available on the Web, but can be very easily overlooked. GrannyBarb puts all of it together in an interesting and easy to read book.Since GrannyBarb is no longer with us, sadly, the book may not be updated. With the pace of research into this and other leukemias in high gear, there are now more treatments available, and in clinical trials, than when she wrote the book. On the other hand, pretty much all of the mainstream treatments that a patient is likely to run into are covered in the book.Highly recommended. If you are a patient, or a caregiver, there is no better book than this to give you the 'lay of the land'.BTW, to the reviewer who was disappointed because AML wasn't covered in this book, well, that's because the book isn't about AML! Geesh! I suppose I could complain that the book didn't cover model railroading, either, but it isn't a legitimate complaint, to my mind.If you have CLL, get this book.

      "description": "When the death of a relative, a friend, or a pet happens or is about to happen . . . how can we help a child to understand? Lifetimes is a moving book for children of all ages, even parents too. It lets us explain life and death in a sensitive, caring, beautiful way. Lifetimes tells us about beginnings. And about endings. And about living in between. With large, wonderful illustrations, it tells about plants. About animals. About people. It tells that dying is as much a part of living as being born. It helps us to remember. It helps us to understand. Lifetimes . . . a very special, very important book for you and your child. The book that explains—beautifully—that all living things have their own special Lifetimes.",

For plants, animals and humans too. Everything has its own lifetime, some short & some long.Doesn't overdo it in sentiment or with pictures. There is typically 1 pictured item per page, not a lot to look at. This is perfect for the premise of this book staying simple & too the point.",

          "comment": "Knowing and working with many young children, I have come to appreciate that there are certain concepts that we, as adults, tend to take for granted as being somehow obvious or, if you will, self-evident. One of these is the inevitability of death. Trying to explain death to a child - particularly to a very young ( 2 - 4 year old) child can be an exasperating experience for even the most well meaning parent, teacher or concerned adult. Luckily, there is a growing body of literature, written to be looked at while being read to youngsters that simplify the essential concept sown to a level that can be understood by the child and will suffice until the child lets us know, through their ever more sophisticated questions, that they need more information. I have a collection of such books that I use and recommend to parents, where death has been a recent event in the family, for use with their children. This book by Bryan Mellonie and Robert Ingpen, is the one I most frequently recommend for use with this youngest group of children.Each page contains a minimum of words with an illustration on the facing page - of which there are only about 20. Immediately, by design, the most common adult well-intentioned error is defeated: that involving giving into the propensity to talk TOO MUCH; to use TOO MANY WORDS; to try to explain the idea in a way that the young child is no where near ready to grasp yet. The initial page and illustration present an exemplary example. On the right side is a simple, hand-drawn illustration of a bird's nest containing two eggs. On the facing (left side) page, the following is the entirety of the text:There is a beginningAnd there is an ending for everythingThat is alive.In between is living.The rest of the text and illustrations bring this same basic idea home to kids via references all manner of living things. Sea creatures, plants, people, birds, trees and insects among them. On the fourth page across from a drawing of a crab:Nothing that is aliveGoes on living forever.How long it lives depends uponWhat it is and what happensWhile it is living.The next-to-last page:So, no matter how long they are,Or how short, lifetimes are reallyAll the same.They have beginnings, and endings,And there is living in between.Young children cannot be expected to understand death as we adults do - or believe we do. The decomposition of bodies, the questions of life-after-death, issues involving illness and disease: all of these are beyond the scope of conceptual understanding of the average pre-schooler. Keep it simple until more complex questions are forthcoming from the child. This book is a good first step in what is apt to be a prolonged, increasingly complex process.If sadness should befall your family (or a pet, or a friend, etc.) and you have a pre-schooler , take a look at this book and ask yourself if it might not be a good place to begin explaining things to YOUR child. I would certainly use it for mine.",

      "rate": "2.0/5",
      "description": "With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",

I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.",

That was definitely not the case, for a number of reasons.First, the writing is not at all impressive. I know economists are not reputed to be particularly good writers, but come on, get yourself a good editor! Some of the sentences were so wordy and poorly constructed that I had to read them several times to figure out how the writer would have written them if he knew how to write at all. And THEN I had to figure out what the sentence said in terms of expanding my knowledge of economics. It was tedious, to say the least.Additionally, the organization of the text within the chapters needs a significant amount of work. The chapters meander; if you are the type of person who likes to organize a chapter's contents into a mental outline as you read, good luck. This author clearly didn't start with an outline, mental or otherwise. It's like he developed each chapter based on chats he had in his living room, which he asked someone to transcribe, then chunked up into paragraphs and called it done.The author also doesn't do a good job of explaining what different terms mean. What's the difference between a tax, a tariff, and a duty? Darned if I know, and I read about two-thirds of this book before deciding it definitely wasn't worth my time.I also found the content he describes in his chapters to be somewhat outdated. It's hard to get a grasp of economics when you're trying to relate what you know about how a particular system works in the present to the way he's discussing it as working in the past. As I mentioned, I have no background in economics, so I have no way of knowing whether the particular system he's discussing has undergone a massive overhaul at some point, such that the system he's describing no longer bears any resemblance to the system I know. If you can't figure out how to integrate what you're reading into your existing knowledge base, you can't expect to expand your knowledge base.I also wish the author were more up-front about his political bent from the outset, as this would have helped me to interpret what he was saying in the context of my own political views.Overall, I do not recommend this book at all. Maybe I'd have a different take if I had read it for a class I was taking, so that the instructor could fill in the blanks and help put certain things into context. But just reading it on my own, with no background in economics to draw on, was pointless.I'm going to try naked economics next. Reviews seem to indicate that it's written by an economist who can actually write.",

The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt.",

          "comment": "Economics in One Lesson is a clear and concise explanation of opportunity cost and price incentives. This book is extremely useful as a supplemental text. The reason why is that most modern economics textbooks pass over opportunity cost too quickly. The basic idea of opportunity cost is easy, but students need to see how the opportunity cost concept applies universally.One way to learn opportunity cost is to read Cost and Choice, by JM Buchanan. Cost and Choice is a great little book, but it does not work well for an intro class. Bastiat wrote some classic essays on opportunity cost, but his work could be seen as a little dated. Of course, opportunity cost is itself timeless, but Bastiat aimed at explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning to a nineteenth century audience.Economics in One Lesson is a modern restatement of Bastiat's essays. Hazlitt writes to counter mid twentieth century Keynesian fallacies. This is an important aim. All to many of us believe that disasters like 9-11 and Katrina created jobs. Too many of us fail to see that the labor and capital that goes into reconstruction has forgone alternative uses. Too many of us believe that capital itself causes unemployment by replacing labor. Labor saved by capital has alternative uses. Even some economists can benefit from reading this book (if they have an open mind) because too few of us see how government spending and credit expansion can displace and distort private sector spending. This is not to say that the free markets never have any slack or are perfect, but the Old Keynesian belief that activist fiscal and monetary policy can permanently increase real GDP is not well founded. Any New Keynesian will tell you that Hazlitt was right about the Old Keynesian economic program.Hazlitt also does fine explaining the basics of price incentives and price and wage controls. Many people will object to what Hazlitt writes about wage and price controls on ideological grounds, but his reasoning is sound. Even pro-minimum wage economists like David Card and Alan Kreuger admit that large increases minimum wage rates must cause increased unemployment. This is a basic lesson of economic theory.The critics of this book generally do not know what they are talking about. Sure Hazlitt does not discuss externalities or asymmetric information, but EIOL is not a comprehensive text, it's a primer on opportunity cost and price/wage controls. Keynesian critics will find fault in its discussions of unemployment, but the fact of the matter is that virtually all economists now reject the Keynesian paradigm that Hazlitt attacked in 1946, including contemporary self described Keynesians. Hazlitt is second only to Bastiat in explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning in an entertaining fashion, and his book is more up to date. All first year economics students should read Economics in One Lesson.",

Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he come over as extremely objective because he doesn't need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won't offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you.Comment Comment | Permalink | Why no voting buttons?

That's the essence of Economics: \"looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy.\"Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, \"Economics in One Lesson\" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do.

Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.",

          "comment": "ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON is an essential work by Henry Hazlitt, of the Austrian school of economics. This piece is well-written, clear, simple and powerful. While it appeared first in 1946 (this edition was updated in 1979) the principles are as relevant today as they were then.The book is intended to emphasize general economic principles and \"the penalties for ignoring them\". Indeed, issues of inflation, deficit spending, commodity pricing, corporate profits, exports and taxes are very much with us today and look in our future.Economics, Hazlitt states, is the science of seeing both general consequences and secondary consequences. While much is made of the former, little is discussed of the latter and therein lies the danger. Government cannot give to one person or group without first taking from another. It creates nothing of value in that giving but in the taking it diminishes and discourages productivity and administers a negative effect on production and the creation of wealth. There is no justice in redistribution by force.Hazlitt writes profoundly of the dangers of inflation. He says, \"...all government spending must eventually be paid for out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation\". Also, \"Inflation plants the seeds of fascism and communism. It leads men to demand totalitarian controls. It ends invariably in bitter disillusion and collapse.\" Strong stuff.On bureaucracy: \"The bureaucrats do not understand the quasi-automatic system of the market, they are always disturbed by it. They are always trying to improve it or correct it, usually in the interests of some wailing pressure group.\"Hazlitt has a gift for making the complex, simple and the abstract, concrete. This book is particularly well-written. In the current debates in Washington, D.C. Hazlitt's voice is one which needs to be heard above the shouting. It is the voice of reason, responsibility and experience. We would be wise to heed that voice.",

Most of the policies we see proposed (and in effect) today fit the basic forms of those Hazlitt dismembered more than 60 years ago.I was blown away by a single paragraph in chapter 5 which nailed the heart of the current housing crisis.",

The author believes that the less interference in economic systems there is the better the economic system runs. He is against make work schemes, excessive taxes, public works, tariffs, a minimum wage, and unions. He is even critical of Social Security. This book was written originally in 1946 so there is no talk of the issue of Globalization and the numbers used are smaller than we are accustomed to, but otherwise it talks about timeless issues. I think it is important to remember that there are other ways of thinking about economics that are not so extreme in their opposition to public works, unions and a minimum wage. I also think that, although the market does correct itself without intervention and therefore the overall arguments of the author are correct, wages, for example, would be a lot lower if we did not have a minimum wage. Many minimum wage jobs require no skills and therefore there are lots of people to fill them so there is no competition for labor and therefore no incentive to offer higher wages. This book left me wanting to read more about economics, not just for more of the author's point of view, but also for opposing points of view.",

By discussing what would have occurred in the absence of these interventions, as well as the true total costs, Hazlitt makes arguments we rarely hear elsewhere these days.Bad economic policy matters. Realities can not be ignored or papered over with more bad policy. We can not spend ourselves out of debt. We can not pile up massive debts to be passed on to future generations. This book explains why.If high level policy makers in Congress and the Executive read this book, they could stop being clueless literally overnight. As we are poised for a 21st century version of \"The New Deal,\" this book is more timely than ever. Read it. Share it. Buy copies for friends and family!",

It should not be taken for a basic economics or introduction to economics manual.The chapters are short and very comprehensible, with a conspicuous lack of technical lingo, complicated graphs or strange data. They are especially advisable to those that want to understand conceptually, in a clear language, some of the inner workings of national microeconomics. One important remark is that the book focuses mainly on microeconomics, (explaining, for example, some effects of prices, consumers/producers behavior, etc) rather than on the big macroeconomics (balance of payments, growth, etc) or international economics issues (trade, FDI, etc).I like the point regarding one of the main troubles of modern-day economists: the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences...I think this not only is true but also applicable to other arenas, like politics. On the other hand, I think the author is too one-sided in his libertarian approach. He is plainly against government involvement and consistently overstates the role of rational markets and the evil of intervention.",

No abstract formulas or theory, just straight forward cause and effect, simple deductive reasoning. Originally written in 1946, updated in `62 &`79, the economic policy areas discussed are timeless, i.e., relevant today. Mr. Hazlitt discusses not only the immediate visible effects of implemented legislation and policy, but also the unintended consequences to the community at large, the not so visible effects.I would recommend this book for everyone, from the casual observer to the economic scholar, and (in my opinion) should be required reading for all politicians and policy makers.",

The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt.",

          "comment": "I understand the general euphoria over this book. It is well written, succinct and, in places, an accurate exegesis of free market economics. In much of the text, Hazlitt artfully debunks incorrect reasoning that often drives economic policy. Insofar as the book limits itself to that modest goal, it succeeds admirably. But when Hazlett more ambitiously attempts to purvey free market economics as singular truth the book falls painfully short.Hazlitt, like other free market economists, forgets that free market theory is only a pardigm. Free market thinking is useful to the extent that the conditions precedent to a free market are fulfilled; but no further. When the assumptions underlying free market thought are not met, the theory may fail. And in virtually ignoring this fact the book founders.For example, Hazlitt never mentions the problem of externalities which free markets inevitably fail to address. And his actors always conform to behavior convenient for free market theory. To paraphrase Garrison Keillor, Hazlett's universe is a paradise where all the markets are strong, all the investments are attractive and all the profits are above average.But there are other failings, too. The dislocations of a free market economy are generally trivialized. Unemployment is almost viewed as a benefit to workers when resultant from free market operations; as if a pink slip were a toll pass for the Yellow Brick Road leading to the Oz of more efficient employment. In several places Hazlitt is inconsistent, as when discussing the failure of marginal producers (a benefit when caused by free market processes in declining industries; an evil when caused by \"excessive\" wage demands by labor). Remarkably, he adverts to the \"inappropriate\" political power wielded by labor and farmers due to their disproportionate numbers, while never mentioning the truly undue influence that corporate largesse has on governing institutions. What Hazlett considers improper political influence most of us would consider functioning democracy.In summary, this book is a useful and brief introduction to free market economics. So long as one recognizes its limitations, well . . .no harm, no foul. But for true economic enlightenment you will have to look elsewhere.",

          "comment": "Hazlitt is one of the prominent voices in the Austrian flavor of Economics. This version of Economics has recently come to the mainstream in light of the economic hardships and out of control spending from the federal government. This book is dated but contains a lot of relevant information. I was surprised to see just how big of a concern inflation and deficit spending was in the 40s to these very intelligent and honest economists.What will you find inside? Well the bottom line is everything you do, no matter how noble, affects someone else in the world of economics. If the government steps in to help one group of people it is hurting another group of people, usually resulting in a net harm. This is because anytime you artificially stimulate, subsidize or promote one behavior over another you are promoting inefficiency or protecting the least profitable option. This raises prices on goods and decreases real wages. The only way to create wealth and grow the economy is to produce more of a product with the same or less effort. This will in the long run make everyones cost of living lower and bring more prosperity to the country. A great example he used was the hypothetical situation where the government continued to subsidize the horse and buggy industry despite the innovation of the automobile. Sure jobs were lost when cars started replacing horse drawn carriages but eventually more jobs were created and the country was a whole lot better off. He also dispels the myth of saving too much money and discusses why it's necessary to save and what your savings accomplishes.Other discussions include real world examples of why labor unions are harmful to the economy, why it's bad to raise minimum wage, evils of price fixing, the problem with subsidizing, rent stabilization and who it hurts, inequities and harm of tariffs, and much much more. I deduct a star from the book because it got a little repetitive after awhile. A lot of the arguments are repeated and there is a definite recurring theme in every problem he poses. This is not to detract from it's validity, and each problem does propose a unique flavor of this principle. A lot of these things I knew were intuitively wrong but the examples he gives makes you nod your head and puts your gut thought into words. This book was a refreshingly easy read and very insightful.",

          "comment": "This is an edited version of a review that I'd previously removed. People didn't feel the first version was helpful, a fact which I suspect to be due to two possibilities, depending upon the individuals involved. For one thing, it was very long. For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in \"It's a Wonderful Life\"). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term \"trickle down theory.\"But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some important aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too.",

          "comment": "Probably one of the more blatantly biased books I've ever read. Should be renamed \"Libertarians are Cool.\" Yes, libertarianism is the foundation of modern economics and seems sensible. But this book is basically a libertarian manifesto shouted really loudly, with no objective evaluation in sight. It is NOT adequate substitution for an economics course, as I hoped it would be.The claim on the back of the book that it is written \"objectively and impartially\" is completely ridiculous; Hazlitt's approach is inflammatory and dogmatic. He compares taxes to \"being robbed\" (96), compares fixed prices to \"coercions\" (116), goes off on melodramatic tangents about evil government controls leading to \"final abandonment of all the traditional liberties we have known\" (123), and basically characterizes any government official as wicked and intending to steal from the masses and head towards \"the seeds of fascism and communism\" (176). Straight out of the cold war.What is peculiar is the fact that he does indeed concede that certain services should be paid with taxes (police, roads, etc.). Why can't those be private too? These implications of Hazlitt's libertarian theories are not explored; they are merely mentioned in apologetic passing. If taxes really are just a power trip, why have them at all? This question remains unanswered.Also, Hazlitt doesn't realize that his claims apply to things that he says, not just other people's purported \"foolery.\" He doesn't mind \"Industry X\" dying because it will \"release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries\" (102), but then gets all bent out of shape when another Industry X goes out of business due to minimum wage laws (136) by pointing out the resulting \"unemployment.\" Why is unemployment bad here, but okay before? He excuses unemployment in the first case as \"necessary\" and then calls out the second instance as \"condemning the people who worked in that industry\" (136). Which one is it? His decision to hide or showcase negative evidence rests solely on convenience, not truth.Read something else.",

If you know nothing about the topic, read it, because it will save you from the pitfalls that have brough on most of modern economic errors. If you know much about economics, read it, because it will correct many tipically wrong notions of economics in your head. It is not meant to be a tratise, nor to solve all problems. Like all great books, it is a simple, concise, yet essential single lesson in economics. From a broken window glass it takes you through all main aspects of modern economics and teaches you an essential lesson: think about the unseen effects of economic policies and actions. Get that lesson wrong and you will find yourself in the midst of a third world economics mentality (which of course you may want, depending on your political position in life).",

I mean... libertarians speak as though the game is over and they have \"won\" in that the correctness of their theory has been fully confirmed.The ancient Greeks during the period of the Athenian empire were the proponents of the most archetypal (and one of the earliest) forms of democracy. Imagine if, after the Peloponnesian war and the fall of the Athenian empire to a Spartan puppet state, someone had declared that democracy was a failed experiment! The course of history certainly does not bear out that presumption. I hear echoes of this sentiment among the hard-line right wing, who speak as though the entire course of human history has culminated in modern times and has now been vindicated in the form of democracy.The socialists don't fare any better. The arguments against them are grounded in such common sense and indisputable fact that they scarcely need to be listed. People like to own stuff. Plus, J. M. Keynes still owes me $2... the cheapskate.The fact is that socialism is an inevitability in a world where the ever-increasing world population renders individual choice more and more meaningless. As powerful as a relatively few individuals may become, those few will always depend on the masses more than vice versa.Marx and Engels foolishly sought to bypass the democratic/free-enterprise/industrial step in economic development, and in so doing rendered their brand of socialism ineffective and that school of thinking has taken on an air of anachronism. You can't side-step the aformentioned phase in socio-economic development any more than you can side-step learning to add before attempting to multiply! Before the proletariat has any reason to overtake the plutocratic \"haves\", they must be beaten down and humiliated for generations.I am personally neither a socialist or libertarian. I am an observer who tends to shy away from systematic doctrine simply because it is useless in explaining such ineffable phenomena as human choice and behaviour. I respect those economists who embrace the chaotic nature of such phenomena and attempt to use them to their advantage.I just ordered this book from Amazon, and I can't wait to read it! Perhaps the game isn't over just yet.EDIT: Having read the book many times over now, I have to say I am truly impressed. It is much more unbiased than you might assume.

          "comment": "Be advised: Mr. Hazlitt has a deep admiration for Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bastiat and approaches economics in much the same way. That his book is a heavy dose of free market economics thus should be no surprise. Neither should be his approach: that of judging economic policies in view of their total effects, not just on a favored interest group, but on all groups, and not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well. For over sixty years this is the tune Hazlitt has been singing. And surprisingly, it is a tune that still strikes a modern-day chord.Deficit spending, inflation, farm subsidies, trade tariffs--pick your modern day issue and you'll find a chapter or two directed to it here. Looking at each through what some might call an Austrian lens, Hazlitt focuses on their supposed fallacies in an upfront, un-intimidating manner. It makes for an enticing presentation--which is likely the reason for its stunning decades-long resilience--but admittedly, its age is beginning to show.The intricacies of modern finance are not to be untangled here, nor is the role of finance in modern economics even acknowledged. Similarly, though the importance of trade is trumpeted, the complexities of globalization are not to be forecast. For these issues, you'll have to turn to books like Greg Ip'sThe Little Book of Economics: How the Economy Works in the Real World (Little Books. Big Profits)or Alan Greenspan's surprisingly readableThe Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World(Tom Friedman'sThe World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Centuryalso isn't bad, but it is a bit too folksy). Approaching economics from an initial condition of equilibrium also seems a bit flat, if only because it describes an economy that doesn't exist.Hazlitt's prescience regarding the results of unnaturally low interest rates, deficit spending, and government subsidies of the housing market, however, are astonishingly accurate in view of the recent economic malaise. That government subsidized mortgages with little to no downpayment from buyers could lead to a glut of bad loans, an oversupply of housing, and a cancerous malinvestment of capital are lessons we are ruing today and risks he warned of decades ago. That we didn't recognize them sooner supports Mr. Hazlitt's ultimate conclusion that our problems are less economic than political, and, with the rest, makes his short little book on economics exceptionally enticing, if not surprisingly resilient.",

It is interesting that the author describes the housing bubble which he did not live to see (this has been pointed out by a number of other reviewers), but what I find just as interesting, the section on imports and exports shows very clearly why making the USD the world's reserve currency has had (and continues to have) a destructive effect on the US economy (since it creates an impetus to hoard dollars [exactly what the chinese are doing] as opposed to spending them on US-produced goods).What I also find interesting (and depressing) is that a lot of the reviews of this are \"religious\": look at all of the one-star reviews -- none of them have any logical objection to Hazlitt, but they all say that they are (in effect) religiously opposed to it. Until people (and Amazon book reviewers are probably slightly more sentient than average) learn to think, we will continue on the current road to ruin.(the above was written before I had actually finished the book: now that I have I am even more impressed, because the last three chapters, on Inflation, Savings, and Lessons learned are eerily relevant to the current crisis, and the last chapter is particularly depressing, since, despite Hazlitt's hope, the governments STILL are going on their merry way making things worse).",

      "rate": "2.0/5",
      "description": "The doctrine of \"Islamic economics\" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.",

Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader.",

The author does not seem well-versed in the history of the Islamic world nor does he understand Islamic economics. He picks up few concepts he thinks will lead him to the conclusions he already knew, so he squeezes Islamic economics into a small area. Contrary to his claims, the main factor leading to the economic decline of the modern Muslim world is the adoption of Marxist ideology - almost every single Muslim country has adopted a Communist regime (leading to political repression by definition). This is not Islamic but rather Jewish Economics. Another factor, among others, would be colonization. Professor Kuran is not an expert on Islam, he would have done better had he sought endeavors in other areas that do not require rigorous empirical testing, perhaps literary work?.",

This book however is bigger than simply the above elements, as it describes a business philosophy. Arie de Geus is a respected business scenarioist and strategist. He developed his craft over many years in a leading multinational organisation and therefore is well equipped to talk about globalism and evolution. This book passes on that craft in the form of a circumspect view from a man consumate in the art of business. He proposes that businesses be: receptive (sensitive) to the commercial environment and opportunity; have an all embracing organisational culture; tolerant of new ideas and have a conservative approach to financing and investment. But above all he proposes that the raison d'etre of companies is not simply profit, rather it is corporate longevity through embracing the above four propositions. He also suggests that today's principal corporate activity is simply a current commercial phase capable of being superseded by some other activity at some later date. In other words, our respective successful business activities and opportunities are only today's fashions! Equipped with such a suggestion, perhaps we are all able to better approach our strategising with renewed objectivity and circumspection. Callum Morrison.",

Instead, those that really succeed constantly adapt, having conserved the resources to allow that to occur. You will develop new ideas about how to help your company succeed.

      "description": "\"Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers.\" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.",

          "comment": "As I have often noted this space is dedicated to the struggles of the American (and international) working class and their allies. Part of understanding those struggles is to know where we have been in order to have a better grasp of where we need to head in order to create a more just, socially inclined world. In my travels over the past few years I have noted, even among those who proclaim themselves progressives, radicals and revolutionaries, a woeful, and in some cases willful, lack of knowledge about the history and traditions of the American labor movement. In order to help rectify that lack I will, occasionally, post entries relating to various events, places and personalities that have helped form what was a very militant if, frustratingly, apolitical (or not purely anti-political, especially against its left-wing) labor history.In order to provide a starting point for these snapshots in time I am using what I think is a very useful book, \"Labor's Untold Story\", Richard O. Boyer and Herbert Morais, United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers Of America (UE), New York, 1976, that I can recommend to all those militants interested in getting at least a first taste of what the once mighty organized American labor movement was all about. For those unfamiliar with labor history the UE, cited here as the publisher, was a left-wing union that was split by the main labor federations during the \"red scare\" of the 1950's for being \"under Communist influence\" and refusing to expel its Communist Party supporters. The other organization created at the time was the International Brotherhood Of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The history of that split and its timing that caused a wasteful break in the struggle for a single industry-wide union that has been the goal of all thoughtful labor militants will, of course, be the subject of one of these entries at a later date.That UE imprimatur, for this writer at least, is something of a plus but you know upfront that this is a pro-labor history. That said, this 400 page book is chock full of events, large and small, complete with very helpful footnotes giving greater detail (mercifully placed at the bottom of the page where the subject is mentioned), that helped turned the American labor movement from an atomized, motley group of conflicting racial, ethnic and political tendencies in the last part of the 19th century to something like a very powerful and somewhat self-confident organized force by the 1940's. After that period there is a long term decline that, for the book, ends with the period of the \"red scare\" noted above and for the rest of us continues until today.In any case here you will learn about the embryonic stages of the modern labor movement after the American Civil War with its urgent industrial demands to provide goods for a pent-up market war-ravaged market and creation of a transportation and information system adequate to meet those needs. Needless to say labor received short shrift in the bargain, especially at first before it was even minimally organized. The story here it should be made clear, the story anytime labor is the subject of discourse, is organized labor. The atomized working class as a whole minus this organization does not exist as a historical force. That, my friends, is a great lesson for today as well.As such, it important to note the establishment in the 1870s of the National Labor Union and its offshoots, later the Knights of Labor and the role of its class collaborationist leaders. Also noted is the fight in the coal mines of the East and the legendary saga of the \"Molly McGuires\" in Pennsylvania our first well-know labor martyrs. Then the fight moves west to the lead, copper, silver and gold mines. That push west can only mean the establishment of the Western Federation of Miners, the emergence of the paragon of an American labor leader Big Bill Haywood, his frame-up for murder in 1905 and the subsequent rise of the Industrial Workers of The World. Wobblies (IWW). Along the way there are various attempts to form a workers party, the most promising, if amorphous, being the Tom Watson-led Populist Party in 1892 before the somewhat more class-based Socialist Party took hold.Of course no political study of the American working class is complete without a big tip o f the hat to the tireless work of Eugene V. Debs, his labor organizing and his various presidential campaigns up through 1920. While today Debs' efforts have to be seen in different way in light of the fact that our attitude toward labor militants running for executive offices in the capitalist state and his `soft' attitude on the question of the political organization of the working class with an undifferentiated party of the whole class, he stands head and shoulders above most of the other political labor leaders of the day, especially that early renegade from Marxism, Samuel Gompers.The first \"red scare\" (immediately after World War I) and its effect on the formation of the first American communist organizations responding to the creation of the first workers state in Russian ( and of the establishment of the internationally-oriented Communist International), the quiescent of the American labor movement in the 1920s (a position not unlike the state of the American working class today), the rise of the organized labor movement into a mass industrial organization in response to the ups and downs of the Great Depression, the `labor peace' hiatus of World War II, the labor upsurge in the immediate post-World War II period and the \"night of the long knives\" of the anti-communist \"red scare\" of the 1950s brings the story up to the time of first publication of the book. As to be expected of a book that pre-dates the rise of the black civil right movement, the women's liberation movement and the struggle for gay and lesbian rights there is much less about the role of race and gender the history of the American labor movement. Not to worry, the black, feminist and gender scholars have been hard at work rectifying those omissions. And I have been busy reviewing that work elsewhere in this space. But here is your start.",

I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a business, is thinking of owning a business or just wants to better understand what the finance world looks like from the outside.It takes a black-box perspective on the subject to avoid dragging the reader into all the minute details while still giving the reader plenty to chew on, like COGS, depreciation, lease vs. buy decisions, and inventory valuation. The intent of this book is not to teach the reader to be an accountant but rather a book to teach the businessperson how to better use accounting as a tool so they can be more effective.And I *love* to use of the example small business of Rosie's Spouse Houses to tie each accounting concept directly to specific \"real-world\" situations. The great use of humor really helps break up what can be a relatively unpalatable topic.The only place this book falls a little short (but for good reason - it's already a long book!) is on financial statement analysis. For that, I'd recommend the book \"How To Read a Financial Report\" by John A. Tracy.I have (and will continue) to recommend this book to my friends who own small businesses.",

          "comment": "You can give someone life--or you can put someone to death. But you cannot &quot;give&quot; someone their own death. Death is a &quot;gift&quot; because it insures our irreplaceableness in God's eyes; it is ours and ours alone. No one can die in my place no more than I can die in theirs. Our willingness to acknowledge this relationship with our own deaths (which above all requires &quot;responsibility,&quot; a term Derrida seems to prefer to &quot;faith&quot;) in turn unites us with God and the self, with the giver and the receiver.I'll admit I hadn't expected a deconstructionist to use terms like &quot;absolute,&quot; &quot;transcendant,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; &quot;self&quot;--in profusion and in earnest. But perhaps Derrida has sufficiently exposed the instability, metaphoric basis and deceptive play of language to be able to employ it without qualifiers, disclaimers, and tedious textual self-referentiality. As is his custom, he represents his own work as a critique of others' works--Plato's &quot;Phaedo,&quot; Nietzsche's &quot;Genealogy of Morals,&quot; Kierkegaard's &quot;Fear and Trembling,&quot; and the contemporary, politically executed Polish philosopher Jan Potocka. While he establishes his distance from Plato and Nietzsche, his re-visioning of Kierkegaard offers new angles without questioning or challenging the great Dane's existential reading of the Abraham-Isaac story. And his alignment with Potocka is so complete as to suggest more an apologia than a critique of the latter's work. Add to these texts numerous references to Heidegger and to both the Old and New Testaments as well as to stories by Poe and Hawthorne, and you'll have some idea of how richly allusive, not to mention dense, Derrida's discourse can be, even in a brief work such as this.The primary requisite for reading &quot;The Gift of Death&quot; is some knowledge of its precursor, &quot;Fear and Trembling.&quot; Like Kierkegaard, Derrida defines religion as access to the responsibility of a free self, which in turn is defined as a relationship consciously and secretly experienced by the individual subject who sees him or herself in the gaze of God. Truth is separated from Socrates' truth by its interiority, by its replacement of reason, ethics, and aesthetics with the sheer horror of the abyss. Compared to Kierkegaard, however, Derrida's account is less romantic, less inspiring, more disturbing. The leap of faith involves not a sacrifice of Isaac but of oneself, a secret and senseless meeting with one's own death. Derrida interprets the absence of woman in the Abraham and Bartleby stories as proof that the &quot;knight of faith's&quot; quest is not the &quot;tragic hero's&quot;. Instead, it is beyond all knowledge, a confrontation with the abyss that marks the Absolute singularity of the self. (This latter observation is reminiscent of Marlowe's inability, or unwillingness, in Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; to share the &quot;truth&quot; of Kurtz' final words, &quot;The horror, the horror,&quot; with Kurtz' fiance.)In the latter part of his critique, Derrida offers a paradoxical criticism of the technological, modern age. Far from becoming quantified or de-naturalized, we have returned to the demonic and orgiastic from which religion arose. Modern man has fallen into inauthenticity, becoming not a self or person but assuming the mask of a &quot;role.&quot; Present-day democracy, in turn, is not about the equality of individuals but of roles. Hence the importance of discovering and accepting the gift of death that determines human uniqueness. Responsibility is the criterion; freedom is the result.This is a work not to be read quickly or only once. Derrida moves slowly, taking two steps backward before moving one step forward, but his method insures the communication of his meanings. If it's any inducement to the reader, I would suggest that the fourth and final chapter, &quot;Tout autre est tout autre,&quot; is anticlimactic and unhelpful. By then the attentive reader will already have located the gift.",

It's also quite a philosophical and spiritual book (without advocating any particular religion). The world would be better off if people followed the book's advice. The book is non-judgmental so use the parts that help you, and you don't have to use the parts that don't.I just \"found\" the book again, and I am re-reading some of the chapters. Great stuff.

      "description": "A strong, idiomatic translation of Italy's greatest modern poet. Eugenio Montale is universally recognized as having brought the great Italian lyric tradition that began with Dante into the twentieth century with unrivaled power and brilliance. Montale is a love poet whose deeply beautiful, individual work confronts the dilemmas of modern history, philosophy, and faith with courage and subtlety; he has been widely translated into English and his work has influenced two generations of American and British poets. Jonathan Galassi's versions of Montale's major works--Ossi di seppia, Le occasioni, and La bufera e altro--are the clearest and most convincing yet, and his extensive notes discuss in depth the sources and difficulties of this dense, allusive poetry. This book offers English-language readers uniquely informed and readable access to the work of one of the greatest of all modern poets.",

Looking back, I would wholeheartedly recommend Arrowsmith's translations above Galassi's.Galassi's translations are accurate as far as the meaning goes, but do not sufficiently mirror the sound of Montale's brilliant Italian, and in several poems they do not translate the mood, the essence of Montale's poetic vision. Arrowsmith's translations have always seemed wonderful to me because they capture Montale's emotion (especially the sly irony of SATURA) and remain faithful to the sound of the Italian. If one wishes to read Montale's poems in English, I would highly suggest you purchase William Arrowsmith's translations. Arrowsmith translated not only Montale's first three books as Galassi only did, but also his retrospective SATURA, some of his best poetry.This edition by Galassi does warrant recognition, however, for one thing. His attached essay, \"Reading Montale,\" does a great deal for the unfamiliar reader to explain the nature of Montale's \"Clizia\" mythos, and his analysis of the cicada symbol teaches the reader to appreciate Montale's complex symbolism.",

First, the haiku provide interesting insights into the lives of the authors. In keeping to the concreteness of the form, one see the authors' experiences more directly. They write more of what happened rather than what they think about the experience in retrospect. Second, the volume provides an example of an interesting approach to a personal journal - an approach than gains values over time rather than becoming the musings of someone you know longer feel you are. So in a strange way, I recommend this book.",

Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a &quot;season word&quot; and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there. Aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by R.H. Blyth, THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY (of English language haiku) by Cor van den Heuvel, and the indispensable and well-respected THE HAIKU HANDBOOK by William Higginson.",

As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material.

      "rate": "2.9/5",
      "description": "Are you relentlessly curious and creative, always willing to rock the boat in order to get things done . . . extremely energetic and focused, yet constantly switching gears . . . intensely sensitive, able to intuit subtly charged situations and decipher others' feeling? If these traits sound familiar, then you may be an Everyday Genius--an ordinary person of unusual vision who breaks the mold and isn't afraid to push progress forward. . . . As thought-provoking as Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence, psychologist Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's Gifted Adults draws on a wide range of groundbreaking research and her own clinical experience to show America's twenty million gifted adults how to identify and free their extraordinary potential. Gifted Adults presents the first practical tool for rating your Evolutionary Intelligence Quotient through an in-depth personality-type profile. Demystifying what it means to be a gifted adult, this book offers practical guidance for eliminating self-sabotage and underachievement, helping Everyday Geniuses and those who know, love, and work with them to understand and support the exceptional gifts inherent in these unique personality traits.",

          "comment": "I had to laugh at the editorial review, which accuses Dr. Jacobsen of being \"elitist,\" one of the many criticisms that gifted people receive. Maybe that reviewer should have read the book more carefully. This is a terrific book that will help people realize their potential. That's a good thing for the world and should not be discouraged or belittled.If you have struggled with fitting in only to feel like you cannot be your authentic self, this book will help you discover why. I also recommend \"Dark Side of the Light Chasers\" and other books by Debbie Ford to help you discover the damage done by all those messages to play small, and begin to heal, giving yourself permission to be BIG.",
