          "comment": "I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!",

It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular.",

It emphasizes the need to listen to real voices rather than relying on Western interpretations of feminism. The book challenges cultural imperialism and prompts reflection on societal norms.

          "comment": "Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, \"You are all liars!\"3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. \"Too much concentration can be worse than none at all\" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The \"I did not know\" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the \"I.\"5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, \"Frees slaves,\" and then \"Call anytime\" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the \"I,\" the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, \"God was in this place and I did not know it was i.\" We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent.",

Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.",

      "description": "\"I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary.\" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, \"Is there another way to lead a good life?\" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts \"spoke directly to me,\" writes Bender. Somehow, \"they went straight to my heart.\" Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen \"glows\" and \"no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday.\" In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her \"crazy-quilt\" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive \"patches\" of her own life. Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, Plain and Simple speaks to the seeker in each of us.",

It's an introspective book that begins in 1967, although the actual 'journey' doesn't come about until 1982. Women shape society, and society shapes women. If all women were as modest as the Amish, we would never have achieved the right to vote. It takes all kinds to make a world.In terms of pages, the book is less than a half inch thick, so the journey is a 'light read'. Amish history can be found on the internet with ease.It's always amusing to me when people grab a book in haste, find it's not their cuppa tea, and then blame the author entirely for wasting their money. For that mindset, I recommend the public library.This is a mid-life soul-searching little book about One Woman's experience at One point in time. The author makes the point that American society is neither plain nor simple for most of us, and reveals how trying to strike a balance between serenity and ambitious pursuits is never easy. Most of us can't even write a Christmas newsletter that anyone else wants to read, but we're sure qualified to pass harsh judgement on another person's honest little journal.Personally, I found this a nice little book for a winter's night.",

It certainly gives believers, in this day, a hearty look at what believers went through, the persecution and martyrdom, that was brutally dispensed back then. It was very interesting to hear the dying words of unbelievers; what widespread sorrow and hopelessness existed in their final moments.I'm a fan of history and I can tell you that some of the dates that are cited by Lockyer are way off. For example, it mentions the war with Britain in 1842 (it was 1812) and U.S. president James Buchanan taking office in 1860 (off by a few years). Since these were so obvious I'm sure that other inaccurracies exist elsewhere in the book. I certainly would take care in verifying the information first, before quoting it in public.A special note: There's definitely an anti-Rome bias that would make it tough for some people to get through this book. Although Lockyer mentions Protestant attrocities, he reserves extra criticism for Roman Catholic ones. It's this lack of objectivity that prevents this work from being a great book, just a good one.",

He sees that there has been a disintegration of traditional value systems. This sickness he sees as having also invaded traditional Judaism.He strives to understand how Judaism can provide meaning in a variety of areas of life, including in sexual ethics, in the place of the woman in society,in the state of Israel. He argues that there needs to be a new Jewish revival of spirit. He says that this should involve a Jewish movement toward combining religious and secular learning. He says that the Jewish world must find its meaning in greater unity, greater mutual caring and concern. He concludes the work as follows:\"Contemplating the dangers besetting all Israel, the threats to our very survival- not at all unlike those in the days of Nazism-how can we think of facing the challenges of the hour without the strongest possible unity of all Israel, without the highest grade of responsibility toward Klal Yisrael, without being carried forward by the deepest sense of Ahavat Yisrael? How can we do it without realizing that Bein kakh uvein kakh , either way, such are the Jews God has still left; that either way, they are the only brothers and sisters still left us, upon whom alone we may count and who count on us!\"Rabbi Berkovits wrote these words nearly thirty years ago at the time of the Yom Kippur War. They of course apply today when Israel and the Jewish people are encountering a new evil combination of anti- Semitism from extreme left and Islamic fundamentalist right.This is a book that speaks to the Jewish crisis even today.",

      "rate": "1.1/5",
      "description": "In this brilliant look at the rise of political Islam, the distinguished political scientist and anthropologist Mahmood Mamdani brings his expertise and insight to bear on a question many Americans have been asking since 9/11: how did this happen? Mamdani dispels the idea of “good” (secular, westernized) and “bad” (premodern, fanatical) Muslims, pointing out that these judgments refer to political rather than cultural or religious identities. The presumption that there are “good” Muslims readily available to be split off from “bad” Muslims masks a failure to make a political analysis of our times. This book argues that political Islam emerged as the result of a modern encounter with Western power, and that the terrorist movement at the center of Islamist politics is an even more recent phenomenon, one that followed America’s embrace of proxy war after its defeat in Vietnam. Mamdani writes with great insight about the Reagan years, showing America’s embrace of the highly ideological politics of “good” against “evil.” Identifying militant nationalist governments as Soviet proxies in countries such as Nicaragua and Afghanistan, the Reagan administration readily backed terrorist movements, hailing them as the “moral equivalents” of America’s Founding Fathers. The era of proxy wars has come to an end with the invasion of Iraq. And there, as in Vietnam, America will need to recognize that it is not fighting terrorism but nationalism, a battle that cannot be won by occupation. Good Muslim, Bad Muslim is a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world today.",

The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N. Graulich",

          "comment": "When I bought this book I was hoping to find a balanced analysis on the roots of terrorism and how American mistakes in foreign policy could have contributed to the situation. Intead, this book is a 260 page diatribe blaming the United Staes for most of the ills of the world. The author uses half-truths, innuendo, and slippery slope arguments to paint the picture of the United States as an omnipotent power that seeks to control other nations.The author sees no distinction between the actions of the United States military and terrorists to include Al Qaeda. He criticizes the US for explaining away civilian deaths as collateral damage viewing it as an Orwellian term. He does this while also distorting the term low intensity conflict equating it to terrorism. However, he fails to point out that the US military goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties, which at times puts them at greater risk. He sees no contrast in the terrorist who deliberately targets civilians. As a result actions of the US and terrorists are morally equivalent since they are both driven by politcical objectives.While the author goes to great lengths to criticize the US and Israel, he fails to assign any responsibility to the actions of Middle Eastern nations that have threatened and invaded Israel over the past 50 years. While Israel shares some of the responsibilty, a balanced approach would look at the how all nations in the area have had a hand in the security and political situation.This book will confirm the beliefs of those on the political left. The right will lose the legitimate issues in the author's obvious political agenda and biases. For those in the center, look for another book.For an American, the greatest value in reading this book is gaining insight in how others see us. While we may not agree with their perceptions, for them it is the reality they base their judgements and decisions on.",

          "comment": "&#60;P&#62;This is an inspired, disciplined, nuanced, Nobel-level book, and if it ends up saving America from itself, then it would surely qualify the author for the Nobel Peace Prize.This is the first of three &#34;must read&#34; books that I am reviewing today, and it is first because the other two are best appreciated after absorbing this one. The other two books are &#34;IMPERIAL HUBRIS\" and &#34;OSAMA'S REVENGE.\"The main weakness of this book is the author's lack of strong criticism of Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and of other states that are corrupt, repressive, and therefore a huge part of the problem. Having said that, here are some of the key points:- &#34;West&#34; pioneered genocide, expulsions, and religious wars, with Spanish genocide of Indians in Americas, and Spanish expulsion of first the Jews and then the Muslims as critical starting points in understanding Muslim rage today- America adopted terrorism as a preferred means of fighting proxy wars in both Central America and Africa, when Reagan began &#34;rollback&#34; with the same neo-conservative advisors that guide Bush II today.- West has four dogmas as summed up by Edward Said (who is admired by the author): 1) that Orient is aberrant, undeveloped and inferior; 2) that Orient is inflexibly tied to old religions texts, unable to adapt; 3) that Orient is inflexibly uniform and unable to do nuances; and 4) Orient is either to be feared (Green or Yellow or Brown Peril) or controlled.- Fundamentalism actually started in the US among the Christians seeking to insert religion into the state's business and ultimately demanding faith and loyalty as the litmus tests for acceptance.- Earlier generations of Islamic reformists disavowed violence, but ended up adopting violence after being in state prisons (e.g. Egypt).- Earlier incarnations of a Muslim revival were in the open literature in the 1920's and then in the 1960's, and lastly in the 1980's to date--our national &#34;intelligence&#34; agencies appear to have missed the importance of all three- Viet-Nam, Africa, and Central America all fostered extremely unhealthy connections between CIA covert operations and the drug trade, with CIA routinely condoning and often actively enabling massive drug operations and related money laundering, as the &#34;price&#34; of moving forward on covert operations.- The obsession with winning the Cold War at all costs essentially destroyed U.S. foreign policy and set U.S. up as the enemy of the Third World [see Derek Leebaert's &#34;The Fifty-Year Wound\"].- Morality in the US has been perverted, as the extreme right, joining with extreme Zionists, has &#34;captured&#34; the U.S. government in both Congressional and Executive terms. Orwellian &#34;spin&#34; together with the labeling of all dissent, made possible by media corporations &#34;going along&#34;, has destroyed any possibility of informed, objective, or actually moral dialog.- The Central American campaign pioneered the privatization of terrorism and proxy war by the US, with secrecy and deception of the US public being the principal role of the US government.- The US Government is explicitly accountable for introducing bio-chemical weapons into the Iraqi arsenal, and thus accountable for the genocide and war crimes attendant to their use.- US (AID) sponsored textbooks, such as those created by the University of Nebraska, routinely used terrorism against Russians as examples in the mathematic and other textbooks being distributed in Afghanistan.- CIA's main contribution to the destabilization of the world has been in its Afghan-related privatization of information about how to produce and spread violence, and its training of tens of thousands of jihad warriors from all over the world who have now returned home and are teaching and leading others.- Under US leadership, Afghanistan has gone from providing 5% of the global opium production in 1980, to 71% in 1990, and even more today--much of which comes to the US.- America not only accepts massive drug activities as part of the &#34;cost of doing business&#34;, but also ignores human rights in its rush to cozy up to corrupt dictators.- From an Iraqi point of view, the 1.5 million or so children that died in Iraq due to the sanctions, must be seen as a major war crime and a form of terrorism, together with the air war with its indiscriminate murder of thousands if not tens of thousands civilians including women and children. The US has killed more civilians in Iraq than it did in Japan with two atomic bombs. Napalm and depleted uranium are disabling US troops as well as Iraqi civilians long after their use in the field.- Economic sanctions, when they have the impact they did in Iraq, must be considered weapons of mass destruction, their application terrorism, and their results war crimes.- The US Government's general disdain for the rule of law, but the incumbent Administration's particular focus on ignoring treaties and refusing accountability (e.g. for war crimes) sets a new low standard for immoral behavior by nation-states.- The UN Secretary-General was forced by the US to ignore the Rwandan genocide because of a US desire to keep everyone focused on Sarajevo, and continues to us its veto power to prevent UN from being effective against racist Zionism, which is routinely committing crimes against humanity with its Palestinian campaign.The author concludes, without sounding inflammatory, that America was built on two monumental crimes: the genocide of the Native Americans, and the enslavement of African Americans. His point: the US is in denial over this reality, while the rest of the world is completely aware of it. He agrees with Jonathan Schell, concluding as Schell does in &#34;Unconquerable World,&#34; that the challenge of our times is in &#34;how to subdue and hold accountable the awesome power that the United States built up during the Cold War.&#34; The last sentence is quite powerful: &#34;America cannot occupy the world. It has to learn to live in it.&#34;",

He portrays the current conflict between militant/political Islam and the West as though it is largely America's doing. In his view, since Vietnam, the United States' strategy of waging proxy wars ultimately begot the current wave of Islamic terror against the west. He also holds the west responsible for the plight of the Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein. While the US has been far from being an innocent by-stander in world affairs over the past three decades, Mamdani gives US military and diplomatic influence a bit too much credit--as though the rest of the world were a marionette doll simply going along with the United State's grand design for history. On the flip side, he does not go far enough in holding terrorists and rogue leaders to account, or even appreciate the autonomy of their participation in those conflicts in which the US has taken part. Nor does he acknowledge the nuances and complexities involved in international relations and diplomacy, the importance for any country to protect its interests, and the utter unpredictability of future events.This book is worth reading to get a better idea of how the United States has contributed to the current state of affairs, but it requires a discerning eye.",

It's one sided.He says _America was built on two monumental crimes: the genocide of the Native American and the enslavement of the African American. The tendency of official America is to memorialize other peoples' crimes and to forget its own - to seek a high moral ground as a pretext to ignore real issues._The Islamic world had not seen an armed Jihad for centuries. But now the CIA was determined to create one. The CIA created the Mujaheddin and Bin Laden.From what I read Muslims are imperialists, they are invaders, conquers, occupiers. They have been fighting off and on for 1,400 yrs. to bring the world under the thumb of islam. The Umayyad Caliphate became the 6th largest contiguous empire to ever exist. So,imho, yes the U.S.A. has done some inexcusable rotten things for the past 250 yrs. but so have the muslims and for much longer. The only conclusion one can come to is that the human race in general as a whole is BAD.Go to Wikipedia and type in the search box Islamic empire and you will see what I mean.Also read Rory Stewart's books \"The Places In Between\" and The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq\" to get a more on the ground feel for these muslims.Islam is a particularly vile religion, imo. Barbaric in its view and treatment of females; founded by a pedophile, that gave the nod to pedophilia in the form of pre-pubescent marriage. So, imho, that makes all followers of islam BAD. Period. There is no explaining away their founder, muhammad, with a nine y/o. He must of had a heck of a time inserting his penis into her (sorry for being gross but that's what it is). A moral virtuous man would not of been able to perform with a child. But muslims claim that the prophet muhammad is \"the exemplar of virtue in human form.\" Muslims are to look to muhammad as a living example of the right way to live. So there you go. They think sex with a 9 y/o is A-OK....virtuous even. Muhammad: a pedophile slave owner, skilled businessman, married into wealth with 11+ wives..... anyway by claiming islam you condone these and it's other evils. The fact that it has lasted and is fast growing only proves to me personally just how evil man can be.Mahammad soon turned to violence and terror (beheadings, assassinations...) to spread his islam. Seems allah conveniently kept sending mahammad revisions too all along the way. And these updates were always more intolerant and violent than the last. Always just what mahammad needed at the time to spur his believers into more violent acts. And in fact they spred and conquered Mesopotamia and Persia, Roman Syria and Roman Egypt. Killing all the way. Mahammad's farewell speech \"I was ordered to fight all men until they say `There is no God but Allah' \".",

It is dedicated to the struggle of all who live their lives with love for their neighbor and do the best they can with what they are given. It is further dedicated to those non-believers who live a life of goodness with real concern for their fellow man. We are all on a journey, whether we want to admit it or not. We only have so much time to accomplish what needs to be done. But in the end, only one thing matters. We are to be united with our loving God for all eternity. The bulk of the book concerns the promise that America holds for all people. In no way are the reflections intended to belittle any group that is true and honest in their efforts to help its followers achieve the goal of unity with God. The intention of the author is to provide some insight to the problems we face as a people. The problems are many, but first and foremost we must have the same interests for others that we have for ourselves. All of the problems we face have the same root. Thus far in our civilizations we have had much education and instruction. Much of this knowledge has lead to misunderstanding and has not addressed the root of our problems. The root is that we are not capable to love others as we love ourselves. If we do not address the root of the problem, then we will not be better off tomorrow than we are today or were yesterday. ‘NOTHING WILL CHANGE FOR THE BETTER’.",

One way to access such older Christian worlds is through the Vintage Spiritual Classics series that makes classical Christian works accessible to believers who often haven't read anything written prior to currently-living Evangelical writers.This is arguably a good introduction to the thoughts and beliefs of early Christian monastics, both male and female. This is a period all Christians should study since it reflects the origins of most early Christian theology and practice derived from men and women who were sometimes just a generation or two removed from the Apostles. It helps Christians get in touch with their spiritual roots and offset some of the spiritual nonsense that occupies much of the shelf space in most Christian bookstores.However, I found this relatively thin (221 page) book a disappointment. First, although it's a first edition for this publisher in 1998, it's actually a reproduction of work translated by a woman who died in 1965 at the age of 76, so who knows when it was actually prepared. Then, it's a translation of source documents for the stories and sayings, but they're sometimes less than easy to follow or \"pithy\" in this format. One really needs to dig for the most compelling and enlightening material. There are a number of more contemporary, extensive and more usefully translated books on the Desert Fathers, a number of which are listed in this book's two-page \"Suggestions for Further Reading\", virtually all of which post-date by 10-20 years this book itself.I suggest consulting Orthodox Christian WEB sites and publishers for good summaries, explanations and references for the philosophy, beliefs and practices of the Desert Fathers since the Orthodox denominations are arguably the Desert Fathers' direct descendents in today's world.",

From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.",

The author's passion is clearly food -- his writing is at its most vibrant and vivid when he's describing the cooking scenes, or Bruno's hunts at the market for the food he uses to prepare the next meal for Laura... I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses. Especially in the beginning of he book, it was almost as though he trotted out every one that he knew just because he knew it. Cussing is like hot sauce -- a little goes a long way.",

Maar hoe kan de moordenaar op twee plekken tegelijk zijn? Onnatuurlijke dood is het achtste boek uit de bloedstollende bestsellerserie rond patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta van auteur Patricia Cornwell. Deze serie, bestaande uit meer dan 20 bloedstollende crimethrillers, betekende Patricia Cornwells doorbraak als grondlegger van de pathologisch-anatomische thriller. Negen gruwelijk verminkte lijken zijn er al gevonden: vijf in Ierland en vier in Amerika. Steeds wordt het lichaam gedumpt op een vuilnisbelt en steeds worden de ledematen afgesneden. Wie pleegt deze verschrikkelijke moorden? Wanneer een tiende lijk wordt gevonden, wordt patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta opgeroepen om de zaak te onderzoeken. Alles lijkt erop dat een en dezelfde dader aan het werk is, maar is er echt sprake van dezelfde dader? Kay Scarpetta en rechercheur Pete Marino ontdekken steeds meer bewijsmateriaal dat wijst op een alomvattend complot, waardoor het gehele land in gevaar is... Patricia Cornwells werk over de vrouwelijke patholoog-anatoom Scarpetta is de bestverkochte thrillerserie ter wereld; alleen in Nederland en Vlaanderen zijn er al 1,5 miljoen exemplaren verkocht. Ook werd de serie bekroond met de Edgar Award en de Gold Dagger.",

At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can't help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn't seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration. Overall, Cruel and Unusual works as a crime novel, but still leaves the reader somewhat dissatisfied at the end.",

My favourites being the claustrophobic &quot;The Body Farm&quot;, and the superbly dark &quot;Point of Origin&quot;. I have loved all the Scarpetta's, and read them at least twice over, and i still think this is the worst.The plot was very complicated, and it all seemed a bit of a mess. The characters were nothing special, and i this is the only book in which Cornwell manage to bore me with her normally insightful computer terminology. It's too long, and basically i dont think it has any substance. There is a great potential. The idea for the plot is superb, and could well have been one of the best, but somewhere along the line it all slips. I cant put my finger on it, but i just didnt come away from this with the satisfaction i normally get out of a Kay Scarpetta book.Nevertheless this is still a necessary book to read if you intend to read the entire series. It is one of the major turning points. The first book to feature Temple Gault, who would later lead to Carrie Grethen, Newton Joyce, and all the other catastrophic events which culminate in the next turning point of &quot;The Last Precint&quot;. each one has signalled a new era for Patricia Cornwell, and each one has not been quite as good as the others. But The Last Precint was still much better than this. It is, admittedly, very clever, but far too complicated, and im surprised it got the CWA's gold dagger.nevertheless, i have given it two stars purely because it is such a major point in Scarpetta's life. You must read it if you intend to read the entire series, but dont expect to enjoy it as much as you do the others.",

'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

I had read the Scarpetta series in order from Postmortem to this one. Her serial killer Gault appears in several of the prior books, and the Scarpetta vs. Gualt finale happens here. I won't give it away, but let me say I was so disappointed that I quit reading the series.The poor ending of this book, combined with the unrealistic events and general lack of research by the author in all her books has made me decide not to read anymore from Cornwell. With books I haven't read by better authors like DeMille, Deaver, Connelly, and Crais I don't want to waste my time with below average books.",

          "comment": "Does anybody really believe that when a joint FBI/police/medical examiner team needs to locate West Coast dental specialists quickly, they would decide the best way is TO SPAM EVERY USER ON PRODIGY asking for a knowledgable dentist to contact them?This book has so many problems, I hardly know where to start. They fall into two main areas -- no, not the print and the page, the pages, at least, are innocent! There are editorial problems, and problems inherent in a story that reads as if it didn't have the author's full attention.Let's begin with the editorial problems. Do you believe that sirens can &quot;whelp&quot; through the sky? (and is that why we say it's raining cats and dogs? or at least, puppies?)Dialogue moves in and out of a &quot;no contractions&quot; zone, which has the characters suddenly using formal diction -- maybe ONE character in modern America could get away with this, but most of them? How often do senior cops and med. examiners, in casual conversation, say &quot;I will not&quot; and &quot;I do not&quot; instead of &quot;I won't&quot; or &quot;I don't&quot;? It's the unevenness that is jolting and extremely irritating, as if there were multiple editors, one of whom didn't believe in contractions while the others did.But the editors can't be blamed for the plot problems and general stupidity of the characters. How many times are we expected to believe that people who are told every other sentence that they should not go out alone have yet again gone out alone? One second they're talking about putting Scarpetta into the Federal Witness Protection scheme and the next, she's going into work 2 hours early so she'll have the whole building to yourself -- does anybody think the readers will be surprised when You Know Who intrudes on Scarpetta's early-morning solitude? It happens repeatedly. It's like a B-grade horror movie -- the characters are idiots who walk stupidly into danger they could easily avoid. But then there'd be no book (not necessarily a bad thing).The main character's resemblance to Superman pales quickly. In a crime scene, only Scarpetta will spot the incriminating footprint. In a crowd scene, only Scarpetta will spot the suspect in the crowd. Why bother with all the other police/FBI/NY Transit Police?Even so, Scarpetta doesn't detect much, she mostly intuits. If more than one person could have done something, you can bet that Scarpetta knows which one did it. How? She just knows. Maybe the rest of the team doesn't know whether the killer is in Virginia or NY, but Scarpetta does. Why? She just knows. If one character has a high-ranking uncle, and she hears that another is vaguely rumored to be related to someone important, you can bet that she'll guess the two are siblings, and she'll be right, and the reader will not get any more explanation. As a reader, I feel cheated -- where is the detection? If I wanted to read about clairvoyance, I'd be reading books in a different genre.The ONE redeeming feature is the scene in which Scarpetta meets the parents of the serial killer. That jumps off the page. What is it like to have your child turn out to be a monster? How would you react? Cornwell should have developed this, made it the focus of the book, have Scarpetta skillfully tease useful information from the parents, DO SOME DETECTION, instead of having her charging around with an arsenal, hopping planes and FBI 'copters all over the East Coast until you, the reader, feel the jet lag.If Cornwell can write that scene, why did she write 400 pages of drivel to wrap around it? I know that she's a well-known, well-respected author, but she was really asleep at the wheel for this one.I only wish Amazon would let you give a book ZERO stars.",

Over the course of the series, humankind evolves from a near-future-tech earthbound repressive global totalitarian state to membership in the magical intergalactic commonwealth of all sentient beings and stars; in ironic counterpoint, the writing and the characters DEvolve from being relatively complex and interesting to simplistic and tedious.Particular point about the tech: for a story written in 1963, the Planning Machine with its ubiquitous teletypes anticipates 21st-century networked computers wonderfully well. Otherwise as sf, striking for the number of ideas that later appeared more fully developed by Larry Niven: the Body Banks, stocked by political prisoners to supply organ transplants for the general populace; the eponymous Reefs resemble the Smoke Ring as environments where humans live in free fall; Starchild :: \"Passerby\"; and even a bit of wirehead foreshadowing, though it goes in a different, more religious, direction.The first volume by itself is interesting enough to rate three stars, as long as you're tolerant of the future tech of fifty years ago; later volumes get worse, to only one for Rogue Star--the writing just goes too far downhill, becoming stereotyped Bad 60s SF",

      "description": "Three stories of a world shared by resurrected humans from all times and places—plus ten more tales by the Hugo Award–winning author of the World of Tiers series. On author Philip José Farmer’s Riverworld, humans from every era and culture have been simultaneously resurrected. Ancient Hebrews, medieval warriors, Spanish Inquisitors, and modern Americans intermingle in this strange new environment, but many still cling to old prejudices. Tom Mix, a silent-film star originally from early-twentieth-century Earth, is journeying among the vast population along the millions of miles of the River, in search of familiar faces from his own time. He’s been traveling the River for five years and believes people are starting to change. But when he’s entangled in a brutal clash between states, he discovers that some are slow to let go of the ideas that ruled them on Earth. This volume includes the novelette “Riverworld,” along with two additional Riverworld tales and ten other short stories, all strange, clever, and profound. Farmer’s explorations of the wonderful and bizarre—from a portrayal of Jesus and Satan as cowpokes to a reimagining of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan in the style of William Burroughs—plunge the reader into “one of the most imaginative worlds in science fiction” (Booklist). This ebook includes“Riverworld,” “J. C. on the Dude Ranch,” “The Volcano,” “The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol,” “The Problem of Sore Bridge—Among Others,” “Brass and Gold (or Horse and Zeppelin in Beverly Hills),” “The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod,” “The Voice of the Sonar in My Vermiform Appendix,” “Monolog,” “The Leaser of Two Evils,” “The Phantom of the Sewers,” “Up the Bright River,” “Crossing the Dark River,” and Philip JosFarmer’s article on the making of Riverworld, “The Source of the River.”",

I devoured Dark Is the Sun when I was in junior high, and read the Riverworld series a half dozen times in high school. As an adult, I was amused by A Barnstormer in Oz. So, when I saw Riverworld and Other Stories at a book fair I picked it up, figuring the price (25 cents) was right.Let's start with the non-Riverworld stories first. Several of them are . . . well, there's no other word for it besides obscene. Farmer himself tells us that one of the stories would only published by a hard-porn magazine, and one can see why. These stories must be what the Supreme Court means when they mention \"the prurient interest.\" They're not erotic, just vulgar. And yet, as literary exercises they contain a certain amount of morbid fascination. \"The Leaser of Two Evils\" and \"The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol\" in particular show Farmer's remarkable ability to lose himself in a character's dementia. But is the cleverness worth the obscenity? One can't help but think that such pieces as \"J.C. on the Dude Ranch\" (I'd describe it, but I can't) are better left in Farmer's desk drawer never to see the light of day.There are some pedestrian stories, too, including the amusing but uninspiring \"The Problem of the Sore Bridge\" which almost features a Sherlock Holmes cameo. It's the image of Henry Miller on the prowl in a nursing home that lingers in the memory, though, not the pedestrian stories.As for \"Riverworld\" itself, the story is not, as the packaging suggests, the first Riverworld story Farmer wrote. His own introduction makes it clear that he wrote the stories that became \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\" first. Nevertheless, \"Riverworld\" is an appropriate foray into the Riverworld. Tom Mix, a character I never cared for in the novels, is much more appealing here. Most provocative, however, is Farmer's take on Jesus - who finds himself resurrected along the river bank with everyone else. Farmer's \"Yeshua\" is a pacifist in the face of senseless violence, a man struggling to maintain serenity when his life's belief has turned out to, perhaps, be false. There was a reference Jesus in Gods of Riverworld; this story fleshes it out. To my surprise, part of me was offended by Farmer's take on Jesus; yet Yeshua should serve to spark healthy discussion over the nature of Jesus, what he really stood for, and what he would make of the way his teachings have been passed down by Paul and two thousand years. Such spiritual examinations are, in my view, nearly always healthy.\"Riverworld\" alone makes this collection worth getting and keeping. As for the other stories . . . . I really don't know. Perhaps if one knows going in that one is going to get X-rated material it would be easier to digest. Perhaps not. Either way, except for \"Riverworld\", none of these are stories that one would ever want to read a second time.",

In time her uneasy spirit is soothed by the sparkling, brilliant sea, and her restless heart finally calmed. But is this new-found tranquillity too good to be true?

It's a departure of sorts from Ms. Pilcher's typical sagas, in that there is a bit of a mystery involved. I LOVE a great mystery!The story begins in London with Laura, married for only six months to Alec, finding she must have immediate surgery and therefore ruining their plans for a vacation to Scotland with a group of her husband's oldest friends. She, INSISTS that Alec go on his annual fishing trip without her which he is reluctant to do; however, only if she will agree to recuperate at the home of his Uncle and Aunt on the coast of Cornwall will he even consider this trip without her. This may seem a bit harsh, but Laura is adament.Insecure Laura, being about fifteen years younger than her new husband, is filled with angst about his first marriage and the friends that knew his first wife. She's also concerned about his mysterious teenaged daughter whom she's not yet met and Alec never mentions.During her stay, Laura begins thinking about her life and all of the feelings that have been bothering her. The relaxing recovery starts to change when a jealous neighbor goes on a plot to ruin Laura's life. The horrible sequence of events are kept secret from Laura, however there are several unhappy moments for her that makes her grow into a stronger individual.As if she doesn't have enough to contend with, Laura is surprised by a visit from her never-before-seen stepdaughter who has her own problem to share with Laura.Rosamunde Pilcher has a wonderful way of writing interesting stories about families; (sometimes) weak women that turn their lives around and become strong.This was usual for Ms. Pilcher in the lovely descriptions; what I really enjoyed was the \"who-done-it\"!",

After a hundred pages, however, I felt a sinking sensation as I realized that this story could not possibly have a happy ending. Bell had done such an excellent job realizing his characters that I felt deeply involved in their lives. After the horrendous atrocities of slavery and the slave revolts and subsequent battles, it seemed that the island was finally at some sort of peace.But what a price! Then as the French arrived to re-assert their primacy and General Louveture succumbs to hubris the precarious peace falls apart and the bloodshed begins again with blacks against whites.This last book completes the trilogy and tells a story that few of us know anything about. Haiti is a huge mystery to me and these books helped me understand a little why this country is the way it is. The legacy of slavery and the battles that were required to end it as well as the enduring suspicians between white and black are lessons for all of us even at this time (maybe particularly at this time).",

Deep Summer is the story of Puritan pioneer Judith Sheramy and adventurer Philip Larne, who marry and strive to build an empire in the Louisiana wilderness during the American Revolution. The Handsome Road tells the story of plantation mistress Ann Sheramy Larne and poor seamstress Corrie May Upjohn, who forge an unlikely bond of friendship as they struggle to survive the cataclysms of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This Side of Glory presents the story of Eleanor Upjohn, a modern young woman in the early twentieth century who marries charming Kester Larne and struggles to save the debt-ridden plantation that her husband’s ancestors founded more than one hundred years ago.",

Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future. In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock 'n' roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights. Watson's characters are brought vividly to life through Travis's touching, powerful and intensely personal voice. A dark and evocative coming of age tale, Sweet Dream Baby begins steeped in innocence and ends in a dramatically different place. \"I can't remember a book that sneaked up and grabbed me the way Sweet Dream Baby did. It's a real shocker by a very good writer.\" --Elmore Leonard \"Sterling Watson's Sweet Dream Baby is one of the finest novels I've read in years, an incandescent blend of gothic noir, Faulknerian dreamscape and bittersweet coming-of-age story.

This is not surprising in a world of readers who can't read more than the words, for the vast majority of readers feel a sympathy with and automatically believe a First-Person Narrator, when in actuality, used to its fullest, it tells a story that (s)he thinks is one thing and the perceptive reader sees is an entirely differenct story. One reviewer said it has a surprise ending; another, a predictably melodramatic conclusion.I shall forgo rebutting other comments such as the secondary characters being stock, that the setting is the familiar stew of small town intrigue and Southern Gothic, and that it breaks no new ground, for these are more of the shallow readings endemic to our state of letters these days.What is important about this book is that it reveals the nature of the story-teller-narrator who unwittingly tells a story that is much more than he thinks it is.Some people will wonder why present tense is used. The answer is relatively simple: It avoids the problems of Why is this person telling me the reader this story now? and Who am I supposed to be? and How can a First-Person Narrator remember all of the action proper and especially every word that every person spoke? Present tense is the natural tense if we are to be privy to a story as it and the mind that tells it evolve.The story and its resolution are set up on the first page, and anyone who goes back and rereads it after finishing the book and who notices during the reading that the child uses almost no subordinate clauses, will see what a well-wrought work of craft and vision SWEET DREAM BABY is. My only compaint is that the title appears to have been changed by the publisher. Mr. Watson surely knows better than to let an editor mess with the spine of a story. And I don't believe for a second that Mr. Watson doesn't know what his story is about. A much more apt title would have been THINGS LOST, for that indicates the controlling image and contains the essence of what the story is truly about.",

I remember being torn between boredom and paying an overpriced amount for this novel at the airport book store. In the end, my need to satisfy my appetite for zombie apocalypse won over.I knew it would be a good buy, though, primarily because I was already familiar with the short story version of Wet Work by Philip Nutman when he wrote for Skipp and Spector's \"The Book of the Dead\" anthology (an AMAZING zombie anthology and one of the first of it's kind). So, the title and author's name alone had immediately caught my eye.Upon realising that Nutman had expanded it into a full sized novel, it wasn't long before I became easily convinced to go ahead and splurge. Was definitely worth it because i've read the novel a few times over since then.It is certainly a quick and easy read and worth tracking down for sure, which i have had to myself since my dog ate my original '93 copy.The story wasn't perfect and doesn't stick to normal zombie apocalypse protocol, but it was memorable and original.So, take this particular zombie story lightly; it takes place in the course of presidency under George H. W. Bush, involves government cover-ups, black ops, there are thinking zombies, some dark comedy, some corny phrases and a shoddily written sex scene that I read with a grain of salt. But, if you can be forgiving, you just may enjoy the creativeness and perspectives in this zombie tale.Keep in mind I give five stars for being innovative at the time of it's debut as much as I do for the nostalgia of when I first read it.If you like zombie adventure, covert operations, plot twists and zombies that retain function and intelligence, check this out.",

Mr. Nutman paints a very vivid picture of the end of the world and I would like to say to those out there who condemn the splatterpunk genre, that they should read this story before making a fool of themselves furthur. Richly descriptive and horrifying, this is what horror fiction is all about. Its like a nightmare written on page with all the claustrophobia and despair of a zombie invasion present. I have to make a personal confession. I rarely remember my dreams, but I sometimes do when they are nightmares. My worst nightmares have been about the living dead taking over the world and consuming the living. Its like Mr. Nutman took the anarchy, terror, and hopelessness of one of these dreams and made it his own. The characters are well structured, the pace of the tale furious, the story well realised. The only drawback: too damn short! I can only imagine what an epic length would have brought forth, such as the scale of the Stand or Swan Song. Mr. Nutman, do me a favor. Write more more more!",

The whole scenario of a comet passing over and killing the immune system of the living and bringing the dead back to life was really cool but it wasn't totally original.

And so the readers see Xanth through Breanna's eyes, which is a great way to see it if you're new to the series.Not overfull of puns, as some of the later Xanth books are, \"Zombie Lover\" follows Breanna as she tries to escape marrying a zombie king. Anthony examines bigotry and racism through her attitude toward zombies, which mirrors the feelings some have toward Breanna herself as she is black.Parallel to Breanna's story are the stories of Jenny, and of the kings of Xanth, who accidently drank Lethe water, causing them to forget where home was. Jenny, an elf and another non-native of Xanth, is writing invitations and planning a massive wedding, but no one knows who the bride is.\"Zombie Lover\" is a solid installment in the series, and is better than some of the recent Xanth books published.3/5.",

I liked the way this book is written, with 15 Seal vets telling their own individual stories, their way. It becomes apparent that there was a great diversity among the Seals and is surely that way even today. I really admire Seals and think that their contributions during Vietnam and since, is something that needs to be \"put out there\" more. This book held my attention throughout and was an easy read. I have found myself getting various books on Seals more and more - they fascinate me. I'm sure that a lot of other people feel the same way. They impress me with their bravery and endurance. Any Navy or other service person would love this book for their tales of adventure and bravery!",

When Civil War veteran John Carter was mysteriously transported to Mars—known by its inhabitants as Barsoom—he found love with Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and a home closer to his heart than any he knew on Earth. After being sent unwillingly back to his native planet, Carter is finally making his return to Barsoom. But instead of arriving at the land of Helium, he finds himself a world away from his Martian love—in the Valley of Dor. Controlled by the Therns, an alien race of self-proclaimed gods, the Valley of Dor is a dangerous realm from which no one has ever returned. There, Carter reunites with his Martian friend Tars Tarkas, and together they mount a daring escape. But when Carter finally makes it to Helium, he will discover his adventure has only just begun, as Dejah has ventured into the Valley of Dor to find him . . .",

          "comment": "This continuation of the Barsoom series adds two more races of people to Martian life: blacks and whites. Despite being written prior to the civil rights movement in America, I felt E.R. Burroughs handled his depiction of black people remarkably well. He admits that black people are strong and beautiful, though they must ultimately be defeated and subdued by John Carter (like the other races).The hero's emergence as the undisputed ruler of all races through military prowess is still troubling. It is hypocritical for a man to condemn the Martians for their 'might makes right' mentality and call them heartless, and then conquer and pillage their cities.The pacing of action kept me interested throughout the novel, despite E.R. Burroughs' tendency toward verbosity. I rolled my eyes as each Martian declared their undying loyalty for John Carter and every woman swooned at his feet. John Carter was built up to be such a model of perfection that he seemed unreal. He was a super hero and not a real person despite the challenges he faced.Of course I am looking at this novel through modern eyes. Contemporary heroes have been transformed into average people that react in very human ways. It is perhaps unfair to judge this early fantasy character based on modern tastes, but I can't help thinking that John Carter would have been a more complete hero if he had shown some human weakness.",

Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman.Knowing that &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel.

Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over.However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh.",

          "comment": "This book, #2 of 11 in Burroughs' John Carter series, is a direct sequel to the classic \"A Princess of Mars,\" and a reading of that earlier volume is fairly essential before going into this one. \"Gods...\" was first published in serial form in \"All-Story Magazine\" in 1913, and comprises one of Burroughs' earliest works. It is amazing how much action the author manages to cram into the book's 190 pages; on just about EVERY page there is some kind of incredible happening or colorful bit. The book really is hard to put down, and yet, at the same time, the end of just about every paragraph could serve as a cliffhanger! The pace of the book is brisk and relentless, and really carries the reader along to another great cliffhanger at the conclusion. In this volume, our hero, John Carter, returns to Barsoom after a decade's absence, and goes to that planet's \"heaven.\" But heaven turns out to be anything but, and our man gets caught up in battles with plant men and white apes, lost civilizations, religious taboos, the plots of an evil \"goddess,\" duels in the arena and on and on. There are two action set pieces that Burroughs really puts over well. One is the slave revolt that takes place halfway through the tale; the other, a bravura, four-way air battle between the forces of the black, white, red and green men of Barsoom. Both of these sections are thrilling in the extreme; better than anything in the first Barsoom novel. It's also nice that Carter, an Earthman on Mars, fights alongside men and women of varied races, colors, and religious beliefs in a common cause; there's some kind of message there--one for tolerance and brotherhood--that we could all avail ourselves of today.Having said all this, however, I must admit that there are problems in this novel that prevent me from giving it a top grade. These problems mainly take the form of fuzzy writing and internal inconsistencies. Burroughs, in this novel, does not do well in describing geography; his depictions of the Valley of the Therns, for example, are almost impossible to visualize (for me, anyway). A map of this planet (such as the one provided in LeGuin's Earthsea books) would have greatly helped, given Burroughs' inability to clearly set out his world. As for the inconsistencies: Burroughs, the \"editor\" of the novel, says he first read Carter's manuscript (for Book #1) 12 years previously; but if he had really obeyed Carter's will (that the manuscript not be opened for 11 years), then he would have only first seen the text of \"A Princess of Mars\" ONE year before! Tars Tarkas is said to be grieving over his kidnapped daughter in one section of this book; then, a few scenes later, he learns of this kidnapping for the first time. Huh?!?! The scene with Carter on the black-pirate cruiser contains many inconsistencies. Carter is said to be fighting five of these men; he kills three of them, and then three are left. Huh?!?! Six pirates are killed, all told, but later in the book, the number is said to be seven. Carter is said to have killed all these men single-handed, although the Thern princess, Phaidor, had helped him. These pirates are all asleep in the cruiser when Carter comes upon them, although they had been sacking the Thern temple scant minutes before. Does this seem likely? Inconsistencies such as this can drive an alert reader crazy. And don't even get me started on the redundant expressions such as \"haven of refuge\" and \"craven cowards\" that pop up all the time. Burroughs improved with age, but these early books are rife with problems that a good copyediting should have weeded out. Still, these minor problems are easily overlooked when one is caught up in the sweep of the story, and this story is as exciting as they come. It really is a tremendous feat of imagination, and one that any lover of swashbuckling fantasy should hugely enjoy.",

What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book.",

He must struggle to overcome them all, if he is to set free his beloved Dejah Thoris from a nested series of &quot;Heavens within Heavens.&quot;If he wins, will he kill the &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; in the title? What will happen to religion on Mars if he does? If he loses...........An ideal introduction to science fiction and fantasy for boys reaching puberty.

This novel was published from January to May of 1913 in \"All-Story\" as a serial, and then published in book form in September of 1918. John Carter returns to Barsoom, finding if he were in time to save Barsoom at the end of the previous book, and searching for Princess Dejah Thoris who he left behind.As with the first book, this one opens with a foreword written by Burroughs, where he implies that this is a true story and that John Carter is real. The story then picks up with John Carter returning to Barsoom, but to an area which he has not seen before. He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \"heaven\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again. The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work.",

The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work.",

          "comment": "Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1st, 1875 - March 19, 1950) continues the adventure started in \"A Princess of Mars\" in the sequel, \"The Gods of Mars\". This novel was published from January to May of 1913 in \"All-Story\" as a serial, and then published in book form in September of 1918. John Carter returns to Barsoom, finding if he were in time to save Barsoom at the end of the previous book, and searching for Princess Dejah Thoris who he left behind.As with the first book, this one opens with a foreword written by Burroughs, where he implies that this is a true story and that John Carter is real. The story then picks up with John Carter returning to Barsoom, but to an area which he has not seen before. He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \"heaven\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again.

          "comment": "At the end of &quot;A Princess of Mars,&quot; the first in the John Carter series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, John Carter got the factory that produced oxygen for Barsoom (the Martian name for Mars) working again, but had collapsed. When he revived he found himself back on earth, separated from Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium and his beloved. Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman. Knowing that it was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel. When Carter returns to Barsoom a decade has passed and he finds himself in that part of the planet that the natives consider to be &quot;heaven,&quot; which proves to be a more ironic idea. Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over. However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh.",

What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book.",

But ironically, it's a paradise that soon turns into a kind of violent warring hell. The plant men are only the beginning. The bitterest enemies are a race of almost diabolical priests, the Tharns, who set loose white apes and plant men to slaughter thousands of religious pilgrims. I'm not spoiling the plot at all, since this becomes clear in the first two or three chapters.Again, there's a deep bond between the hero, John Carter, and a brave and stunning young woman named Thuvia. John Carter, a warlord, is not content to merely escape. He must somehow end this evil empire of hypocritical priests and mass slaughter.One fine element is the reintroduction of the green warrior chieftan, John's dear friend from the first novel in the series.There are strains of deeper thought woven throughout. For example, the biting satire against mindless &quot;fanatic&quot; religions.Heck of a book. Burroughs writes in a style that would seem a bit heavy today. But after a chapter or two, the reader usually can get in the stride. These books read fast-- you can't put them down. The heroines are GORGEOUS-- but the language is &quot;clean&quot; and the books can be recommended for teens. The description-- often in battle scenes-- is up to anything written in adventure science fiction today. This book was written-- amazingly-- in about 1917.",

It’s a real message of hope.’ Michael Morpurgo Discover this beloved masterpiece of nature writing that is a hymn to creation and to the power of the individual to do their bit to change the world for the better. In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley. Elzéard’s solitary, silent work continues and the narrator returns year after year to see the miracle he is gradually creating: a verdant, green landscape that is a testament to one man’s creative instinct. A beautiful story of hope, survival and selflessness, The Man Who Planted Trees resonates as strongly with readers today as when it was first published.",

I got the book because it was just a regular paperback, planning on reading it much later in the year than now. But when you hear all the hype about this, for once just believe it and find out for yourself! Approach with caution, it'll grip you from the first page! Then the nouns, verbs, adjectives, all that good stuff just falls into place. The excitement Koontz serves up is very electrifying in more than one way! OK!Join EVERYBODY from Deucalion, the tattooed man, Carson O'Connor, the NO-FEAR detective, her partner, the arrogant, yet somewhat laid back, Michael Maddison. How long has Deucalion been dealing with his situation? What is his purpose? Maybe ask yourself how long this dude's actually been around for! You'll find out.At the same time, drink in the anxiety of Randall Six, with his crossword puzzles and daily routine. Yet stagger with fear while you observe Dr. Victor Helios. What kind of a man is the good doctor? Hey, is he a good doctor? How long must one endure? Enjoy the human side of all sides of this creation! Koontz quotes the great C.S. Lewis to prepare us, yet humbles even the likes of one Mary Shelley. Have I read Shelley's version? Nope? Am I likely to? Probably not. I think if Koontz were to hear that this isn't like Shelley's original, he'd probably be the first to say thank you. It wasn't meant to be.As usual with Koontz, expect the unexpected! Be pleased with as surprises arise, yet let your heart share in small bits of sorrow. But don't be surprised if you steal a few laughs as you bite off that last fingernail! We don't know what will happen next, but I do know this. I can't wait for more! The question is, do you dare take the risk of this first book?",

I found the usual Koontz witty style of writing, which I love. I also enjoyed this book more because there were more storylines to follow and they all collide which each other very nicely. Very well thought out.The character development is also very well done. Each character complex and likeable or hateable. But, as each character develops, there are zero dull spots in the book, as some novelists spend too much time trying to develop characers with too many words.The evil in this book outdoes most of Koontz's earler works. Sometimes I worry about Koontz, because these characters are so twisted and warped, I don't know if Koontz is quite sane or not.I loved it and look forward to Book 2. It's a great modern take off of the original Frankenstein story. Well worth the time of any thriller/horror readers!",

I love it. Quick, easy reading.I must admit that when I was reading the back cover at the store I thought it was going to be another serial killer book, set in New Orleans, with probably some supernatural connection, given the author.

I love the characters - especially the sarcastic combativness between the two main detectives.I wish I could see this as a movie, as it was intended.

          "comment": "Though a fan of Koontz, when I first saw the title of this book I was afraid it would be trite. But I was wrong. This is one of Koontz's best efforts in years. He does not rewrite the story of Frankenstein, rather, he builds on it.It is the present day and Dr. Frankenstein is alive and well and continuing his efforts. His goal is more clarified. He is no tragic figure, but an evil man bent on building a race of perfect beings that will replace humanity. Over the two hundred years since the events portrayed in Mary Shelley's book (which, in an nice twist, is explained as a semi-historical account based on legends and hearsay), Dr. Frankenstein has amassed a fortune and a vast biotech empire. Through modern genetics and science, he no longer has to piece together his creations from dead humans. He grows them and programs them with directives and information. He and his creations bide their time, infiltrate humanity, and await the time to strike openly.Opposing these efforts is Dr. Frakenstein's first creation. The Monster still lives, but has become more and more human while his creator has become less. Koontz and Anderson do a great job of portraying the monster as a suffering man, noble in spirit yet malformed in body. His path and mission cross paths with two homocide detectives on the trail of one of the New Race who has become a serial killer after he realizes that his programing and superior genetics has left him empty, missing something that humans seem to possess.Koontz and Anderson's decision to place the story in New Orleans was a stroke of genius. They do a good job of capturing the mood of what is perhaps America's most foreign, haunted city. The food, the history, the music, the graveyards. All are effecitvely portrayed and woven into the story.The book is a quick read, with 4-5 page chapters dealing with one sequence of events, the moving to another. Despite this, it does not come across choppy. The writers keep the pace going while making the narrative clear.A good book. Reminscent of, though not quite at the level of, Koontz's excellent Twilight Eyes.",

How else could you explain the ability to read a novel that nears 500 pages in a matter of two days? That being said, we still enjoy those types of films and shows for the value they do offer: they help us escape our mundane lives through fantastic storytelling and fast-paced action. This is what you should expect from Prodigal Son, the first book in the straight-to-paperback Dean Koontz's Frankenstein series.The story takes place two hundred years after the end of Mary Shelley's classic novel, in modern-era New Orleans where Frankenstein's monster, having renamed his self Deucalion, is working closely with two homicide detectives on the trail of the copycat serial killers. One killer, having previously been hell-bent on ridding the human race of ugly people, has switched motives to collecting the most beautiful female body parts he can find. The other, a genetically engineered evolutionary advancement created by Victor Helios (aka Frankenstein) is gutting male victims in attempt of discovering the part of the human race that he lacks: the source of happiness.Koontz's signature short chapters are action-packed and move the story along quickly. As is the case with his other novels, the supernatural and/or abominable nature of science fiction plays an important role in the story's development. Those facets always seem to give Koontz an easy escape from tricky plot developments. Nevertheless, the novel is a valid contribution for its unique monsters and the creative villainy of Victor Helios.If you're in the mood for \"Shakespeare in Love\" or \"The Shawshank Redeption,\" read something else. If you're craving a mindless horror flick, Dean Koontz's Frankenstein: Prodigal Son (Book One) is worth two or three days of your reading list's time.",

Just as I expected, the story swept me away with a high caliber of writing, intriguing characters and a plot that kept me interested all the way through to the end. If you are looking for classic Dean Koontz, you won't be dissapointed. This is, however, the first in a series, so while there is some resolution in the end, much is left wide open for the following books. If you've never read Dean Koontz, this is a great book to start with-it is a well-told story that adds to and magnifies Mary Shelly's tale. Oh, and one more thing: the chapters are all fairly short, which is something I haven't seen in a Dean Koontz novel. Those of you out there who don't have much time to read (much less think) will enjoy quick chapters that leave you wanting more. Hope this helps!",

Koontz references the story we all now and simply fast-forwards to our time, keeping the original Victor and his monster, and giving them longevity.The prose is ellegant and the speed is neck-breaking. It appears that Mr. Koontz uses 'big' words and paints detailed scenarios that may intimidate some readers, but I challenge you to read his work out loud - you'll see how nicely the words roll off your tongue.",

Koontz introduces a take-over of horrific proportions, where human kind is faced with a new and terrifying race that has been designed by the murderous and powerful Victor Frankenstein. Koontz introduces a scientific world that is both fascinating and terrifying. I highly recommend this book and the series as a whole.",

It was a bit hard to follow in parts but the story line was interesting enough to keep me at it. I liked the fact that the heroine is a strong yet vulnerable woman who can stand on her own but also knows when to lean on her man. The hero is a very sensitive man who probably because of his heritage makes him irresitible to his heroine.This is a combo of a timeswept/fantasy romance. The heroine, Taffy starts off in the 1880's and ends up in the 1640's. She is helping her father with his archeology by taking photographs of the bones they have discovered of a piper. The piper was killed after warning of a trap. His hands had been cut off and he bled to death. While taking the shot she sees a ghost who happens to be the piper himself. The piper, Malcolm, is our hero. She is sent back in time to save him by the fairies. She and he both are of fairy blood and the fairies need them.Together they must overcome their human enemies and the fairy dangers which await them. I enjoyed the excitement in this book. You weren't sure what was going to happen next. I plan on reading more of thisd authors works in the future.",

      "description": "The Forsyte Saga was the title originally destined for that part of it which is called The Man of Property; and to adopt it for the collected chronicles of the Forsyte family has indulged the Forsytean tenacity that is in all of us. The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was even then the prime force, and that family and the sense of home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts to talk them out.",

          "comment": "The first volume of \"The Forsyte Saga\" contains three novels and two interludes between each. It chronicles the lives of the Forsyte family between more than 30 years. In his narrative, John Galsworthy deals not only with the family's fortunes but also the society of their time, and its changes.\"The Man of Property\" is the first novel of the monumental Forsyte Saga and in the beginning the writer spends some time creating his environment where those Forsyte will inhabit.The first chapters turn out to be the more descriptive in the book. Not only does he introduces the most important members of the family, but he also describe their moral-social relationships -- that count much more than their blood relations.Once Galsworthy feels that his characters are established -- and it doesn't take too many pages, as a matter of fact -- he starts the narrative per se, although a slight plot has been developed from the beginning.\"The Man of Property\" concerns more on old Jolyon Forsyte's life and his son and his nephew Soames and Soames' wife, Irene (one of the most unforgettable characters in the saga). Soames is the man of property, but not only has he got unanimated properties but he also considers himself the owner of Irene. She will involve herself with another man, and this love affair will affect the all Forsytes in some levels.This novel is a great beginning for Galsworthy's saga, with vivid characters, a well-built plot and charming writing. While the writer is developing the family affairs, he has the chance to portray the changes in the high society life in the early XX Century in England.In the second installment of \"The Forsyte Saga\", the writer reassumes the life of the Forsyte family. \"In Chancery\" is situated a few years after the events told in \"The Man of Property\", in a few pages recaps some of the most important facts of the first book and their aftermath. After that he is able to move on.And on he moves -- but the narrative still concerns on young Jolyon, Soames and Irene that forms a love triangle. While the remaining Jolyon become a close friend to Irene, her ex-husband --from whom she hasn't divorced in all those years -- fells jealous and considers claiming his wife back.Needless to say that this is not the only plot in the novel. Galsworthy develops more family plots. It is impossible not to have the feeling that while he is sometimes depicting the shallowness of the elite from his time, at the same time he has an indulgent look upon the rich and wealthy -- which is not a bad thing as a matter of fact.Those who like \"The Man of Property\" will certainly find more pleasure in \"In Chancery\". He finishes the book with the perfect hook what will come next.For those who liked \"The Man of Property\" \"In Chancery\", \"To Let\" is a treat. At this point we are in a transition. The old school of Forytes (Jolyon, Soames...) is about to `resign', while new folks are starting to assume the power and the money (Jolyon's third son, Soames' daughter...). The very old Forsyte school, by the way, is already history.\"To Let\" is a novel of transition; it is as if the parents are passing the command to their kids -- at least in terms of narrative. That is why old plots (Irene, Somaes, Jolyon) and new ones are in the center of the narrative.The story is set some twenty years after the ending of \"In Chancery\", Soames' and Jolyon's kids are virtually adults but they don't know the plot involving their parents (the story of the first and second novel) and are ready to fall in love. It is not surprise that Fleur (Jolyon's French kid) will fall in love with Jon (Jolyon's third son also named Jolyon).But their main obstacle is not the fact that they are cousins, but the relations from the past. The narrative will focus on this Romeo and Juliet-esque couple whose union --or separation-- lies in a secret hidden in the past.Those who have reached the third installment in the saga are those who have liked it and are looking forward to see what will happen to the Forsyte. So it is no mystery that Galsworthy exploits the family changes as a shadow of the change in their society --set about the 20's of the XX Century. As Britain Empire declines, so does the power of the Forsytes that cannot avoid their hidden skeletons.",

          "comment": "I originally posted this review anonymously.20 of 25 people found the following review helpful3.0 out of 5 stars WHO NEEDS HAPPINESS WHEN ONE CAN HAVE APPEARANCES?, September 6, 1998By A CustomerThis review is from: The Forsyte Saga (Windsor Selections) (Hardcover)Re: THE MAN OF PROPERTYStep into the world of upper middleclass London of the late Victorian era, staunchly embodied in the several brothers Forsyte, their sisters, children, inlaws and grandchildren. It's a world motivated by keeping up appearances and exercising the strictest control over expression of one's emotions -- that is, if one is to preserve one's status as a proper member of the upper middleclass. Indeed, the only safe emotion is curiosity about how much others have paid for their possessions and whether they are to be congratulated or envied for acquiring something for nothing, or shall they be sneered at and ridiculed for having paid more. The Forsytes are a commercial bunch, everything boils down to financial value for them -- even relationships bear price tags.Old Jolyon is patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Unlike his brothers, he is now scornful of that middleclass ethos they so highly value, often to their detriment. Old Jolyon has lived long enough to regret his deference to appearances, which had cost him his relationship with his only son.The author's indictment against the stern, uncharitable principles cherished by the British upper middleclass is peppered throughout the narration, the characters always replacing any thoughts toward generosity with sound justification (read: excuse) for niggardly self interest. We are used to categorizing characters as victims, villains and heroes. However, in this story it can be argued that everyone is a victim; there are no real heroes or real villains. Because of his unsympathetic nature, cousin Soames might appear a villain, but truly he is as tragic a figure as Mr. Bosinney (the fiance of June, Old Jolyon's granddaughter) who is in love with the tragically beautiful Irene, Soames's wife. Although the reader is generously privy to the thoughts and feelings of the members of the clan, including disagreeable inlaws, it is noteworthy that the reader is only aware of the two tragic characters, Bosinney and Irene, as they are observed by others. The author never allows the reader to trespass directly into their souls to expose all therein. Fortunately for us, these two wear their hearts on their sleeves and others are thereby enabled to read volumes simply by taking advantage of brief observations. We see the reactions of Irene and Bosinney, never their internal motivations.The title of this book begs the question, exactly who is the man of property or to which man of property does the title refer -- and what exactly is the property that is referenced. Ultimately cousin Soames is the man specifically identified in the title, and surely the property particularly stressed is his unyielding wife, the incomparable Irene. Irene is so much the sophisticated lady, so beguiling in appearance and manner, I am reminded of Jane Austen's \"dear Jane Fairfax\" (\"Emma\") who, like dear Irene, has no money of her own and therefore is compelled to select between the lesser of two (or more) quite unattractive situations. For certainly, when one's station is so reduced, being without the means to _choose_ between this pleasant possibility and that pleasant circumstance, one simply must _decide_ which evil will produce the least harm. In The Man of Property, everyone is selecting -- sometimes their choices backfire and then they must decide the next step. June happily _chose_ to become engaged to marry Bosinney, but later she has to _decide_ how best to keep him or even whether she is at all capable of keeping him.Bosinney also brings to mind another brooding young man from literature -- Mr. Ladislaw of George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\", who also was tragically in love with another man's wife. Indeed, when reading the description of Bosinney's high cheek bones, casual manners and the intensity of his emotions, one might be tempted to cast the actor Rufus Sewell in that role; for Sewell's portrayal of Ladislaw was quite memorable in the Masterpiece Theatre television adaptation of \"Middlemarch\", another story about keeping up appearances and making happy choices or miserable decisions.The Man of Property moves along very quickly. The author's descriptions of the lifestyle and environment of that time are quite detailed. But for the selfish and unpleasant people who populate this world, the sensitive reader might easily drift into this other time and other place, which for this reader is the mark of a truly rich literary experience.",

          "comment": "Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \"The Forsyte Saga,\" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \"Saga\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to \"own\" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than \"property.\"The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English \"Age of Innocence.\" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (\"Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl\") and lushly written descriptives (\"... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago\").Yet there are touching moments too, like Old Jolyon paying a visit to his estranged son and his lower-class second wife, and the grandchildren he has never met. The awkwardness, love and pain in these scenes is truly astounding.As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to \"own\" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the \"Forsye Saga,\" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.",

          "comment": "\"The Forsyte Saga\" is a monumental masterpiece reaching the highest level of narrative skills and literary beauty.Mostly known for the television adaptation, this heck of the book is no less amusing than BBC Masterpiece Theater, even more... it surpasses television genre in what it's always appreciated by the readers - art of the written language.Despite its length, events which are taken place in the lives of three generation of Forsytes, are hugely engaging and elegantly placed in the background of Victorian and post Victorian era, wonderfully described by the author. For that reason I didn't have any problem to \"travel\" through the book pages without slightest feeling of boredom or exhaustion from reading.As a reader it is so easy to quickly befriend some of the main characters, as well as find almost personal grudges toward less amiable personalities like unimaginative, solicitor Soams (\"Man of the Property\"), who's obsession with acquiring goods, degrades even his wives to the level of material assets. In the first group I would definitely include the Old Jolyon, for whom John Galsworthy dedicated entire interlude between first and second part of the book, and which is one of the most charming and poetic sequence in the novel.I found Galsworthy narrative to be extremely clever, elegant, observant, poetic, up to the point of the highest level in art. The only sadness which I feel is that many times I found this beautiful literary creation, to be underrated and not included in the list of \"must read books\" of 20 century.",

          "comment": "The Forsyte Saga is a sprawling drama in 3 Volumes/novels which won John Galsworthy the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. I enjoyed all 3 Volumes immensely - the writing is most beautiful, the storylines absorbing, the characters felt \"real\" and the dialogue wonderfully engaging.All 3 Volumes are published by Penguin. Each Volume has 800-900 pages and is divided into 3 Books:1. Volume 1: \"The Man of Property\", \"In Chancery\" and \"To Let\".2. Volume 2: \"The White Monkey\", \"The Silver Spoon\" and \"Swan Song\".3. Volume 3: \"Maid In Waiting\", \"Flowering Wilderness\" and \"Over the River\".Here's the gist of the story from each Volume:Volume 1: Meet the Forsytes - a rich, upper-class family in old England. Before you start, study the 'Family Tree' page first because it's helpful to remember how the numerous major characters are related. Note: My review will not be revealing any plot that you can't already gather from the Family Tree. The story begins in the late 1870s with Soames Forsyte (an old-fashioned, smart solicitor and art-collector) falling in love with a penniless beauty, Irene (pron.: \"I-re-nee\"). They marry but Irene is unhappy because she does not love Soames. Later, she meets a young architect, Philip Bosinney - they fall in love and have an affair. Problem is, Philip is June Forsyte (Soames' niece)'s fiance. Suspense, drama and great tragedy ensue when Soames and June find out. Some years pass. Jolyon (a cousin of Soames and an outcast of the family) and Irene are thrown together by circumstances and they fall in love. Irene has his child, Jon. Soames is heartbroken a second time. There is a bitter divorce. Soames later marries a French woman, Annette and they have a child, Fleur. Fleur and Jon grow up and fall in love with each other, unaware of the feud between their families...Note: Both the book and TV-series (adapted in 2002) feature Chopin's music (which is played by Irene on the piano). So if you like Chopin, you'll be pleased! Another thing is that the reader will either love/hate Irene. The author only describes her actions, but never let us know her thoughts or feelings. Everything we read about Irene is from the eyes or viewpoint of the other characters. Hence, on the pages, she appears cold and distant. Personally, I do not like Irene; my sympathy lies with Soames (whom I feel is unfairly and cruelly treated by Irene).Volume 2 is about Fleur and her relationship with her ageing father (Soames) and her husband (Michael Mont). Initially, Fleur appears to handle married life well - 'grooming' her husband for Parliament and throwing social parties. But 3 crises emerge to test her: a court action filed by a former friend (lots of mud-slinging here), having to \"manage\" Wilfrid Desert (her husband's best friend who is in love with her) and the return of Jon to England and their rekindled love. There is also an engaging subplot involving an impoverished balloon-seller, Tony Bicket and his wife.Volume 3 is unputdownable (like Volume 1). Here, we meet the Charwells, distant relations of the Forsytes (Michael Mont's mother is a Charwell). The time period is 1920s to early 1930s. The heroine is Elizabeth (\"Dinny\"), a most charming and endearing character. In Book 1, she tries to help her brother, Hubert who faces a murder charge. She also has to fend off 2 (unwelcome) admirers. In Book 2, Dinny falls in love (at last) with someone who first appeared in Volume 2. Their relationship is not smooth-sailing and you just know Dinny is headed for a heartbreak. There is also a troubling religion issue with no practical solution in sight. In Book 3, Dinny helps her younger sister, Clare who runs away after physical abuse by her husband. There is later a court proceeding (which is superbly written). Meanwhile, Fleur provides some smart advice and shows her generosity in an unexpected way. As for Dinny, she has not recovered from her earlier heartbreak but a new suitor appears on the scene (and he is really quite perfect...). Volume 3 is romantic and I loved it best.The Forstye Saga is a glorious and unforgetable read. It has the power to draw every sorts of emotion from the reader (joy, sadness, suspense, anger, laughter, tears). Put this title high on your list of must-reads. All 3 Volumes are highly recommended!",

It seemed to confirm what I'd feared for the last several years: even critics have left this spectacular collection behind.Perhaps it is the fact that of the book's length that frightens off so many readers: at 800+ pages it doesn't exactly make for easy beach reading. Keep in mind, however, that the book is comprised not only of three separate novels but also of connecting interludes.If you want to read truly great literature of such a standard that earned John Galsworthy a Nobel Prize for Literature, you need look no further than &quot;The Forsyte Saga.&quot;",

I could not put it down. The characters -- although numerous and many with the same Christian names! -- are kept distinct and are extremely vividly drawn. One realizes how the social sanctions of the day kept people in their place -- just the discussion of what divorce did to a family alone is worth its weight in understanding how social mores have changed. I thought I would be bored stiff and came away 4 days later after finishing this book wanting to start the next one, 700 pages and all. Enjoy!",

I have read other novels from the Victorian Period that I have liked, but this one seems overly wordy and dull in my opinion. I gave two stars instead of one for the mini novel Indian Summer of a Forsyte, the best part of the series, which saved this from a one star reveiw. It was touching and beautiful to read.

          "comment": "Galsworthy was the first to borrow the term &quot;saga&quot; from the Nordic epic poems to apply to a lengthy novelistic study of a family: the trilogy, his masterpiece, influenced more writers in this century than probably can be counted (most eminently Robert Graves and -- in THE YEARS -- Virginia Woolf). Although it very quickly went out of fashion among the modernist writers of his time, THE FORSYTE SAGA has remained a popular hit, inspiring no less than two famous BBC mini-series. And it's the real deal: I can think of few novel cycles that are as satisfying or as eminently readable, much less that are as minutely crafted. (The continuing themes of possesion and death cycle throughout the saga in such fascinating ways that it is almost impossible to believe Galsworthy wrote the first novel, THE MAN OF PROPERTY, without intending to build a trilogy out of it.) The best edition in print seems to be the Oxford World's Classics edition in that it comes with an indispensable family tree.",

          "comment": "Galsworthy's \"The Forsyte Saga\" is simply masterful. A society epic, a romance, a satire, a character study, and a concept examination (of the effects of beauty on people's lives), the Forsyte Saga tells many stories but centers on the tragic marriage of Irene and Soames. Irene has married Soames under duress from her stepmother, and she detests him. Soames views all things in his world as possessions, including Irene. The tragedy of this marriage begets more tragedies among other characters who swirl into and out of the narrative. Other, unrelated tragedies in the Forsyte family dovetail with Irene and Soames's as we come to know a great number of aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and cousins. But \"The Forsyte Saga\" is not all heavy; many of the characters are terribly funny (what could be better than senile aunties?), and Galsworthy's comments on society are acutely witty. Galsworthy draws his characters so superbly that when the books first came out, readers wrote to him claiming that he must have based characters off of acquaintances of theirs. Galsworthy's prose is elegant, fluid, and sparkling with energy, making \"The Forsyte Saga\" beautiful and very readable, despite its heft.",

          "comment": "John Galsworthy (never \"Sir John\" only by his own choice, though he did accept the Order of Merit), one of the notable British writers of the first quarter of the 20th century, has subsequently faded somewhat from the canon of British writers in the 20th century, despite his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. Galsworthy was a very traditional Victorian/Edwardian writer in his style, despite making his books social criticisms of Victorian/Edwardian values; his best work coincided with the rise of artistic modernism, which has tended to overshadow his more traditional approach. \"The Forsyte Saga\", a collection of three novels linked by two short stories, is Galsworthy's magnum opus, and has been twice adapted by the BBC into major miniseries (first and most famously in 1967, and again in 2002); it has lingered moreso in the public consciousness than its author. This large volume collects the entirety of the original quintology (some spoilers follow).The first (and, originally planned to be the only) novel in the series, \"The Man of Property\", was published in 1906, and set in the high Victorian period, focussing on the Forsyte family, the numerous long-lived sons and daughters of Jolyon 'Superior Dorset' Forsyte, and their own descendants. There is Old Jolyon ('Superior''s eldest son), who has estranged himself from his son Young Jolyon for the latter's scandalous affair, and has raised his daughter June, who is engaged to an architect; and Soames Forsyte, the son of Jolyon's brother James, who is married to Irene, and commissions the architect to build a house that he hopes will help revive the passion in his relationship with Irene.Galsworthy's twin focuses, which carry on through the whole series, are the strictures of Victorian values of commerce and proper behaviour (which particularly impact the two Jolyons), and the subordinate legal position of women in society (though the ridiculous divorce laws also hamstring men, as we later see). These carry on through the subsequent novels, published more than a decade after, and the two short stories (the second short story, \"Awakenings\", is honestly pretty throwaway, but \"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\" is lovely). Galsworthy's writing style is eminently restrained; Soames' decision to force himself on his wife Irene near the climax of the first novel is only described briefly in a single paragraph, and the nature of this act is never verbalized (or even narrated) by anyone for almost the entire remainder of the trilogy, even though it is absolutely essential to understanding what's going on. Stiff upper lip, indeed. The characterization really sells the story; the plots are frequently not anything to write home about (the third novel even opens with a quote from \"Romeo and Juliet\", which would tell people in fair detail how the entire main storyline will play out, until the very end, which is more muted).Recommended.",

This richly textured American Book Award Winner, is a sort of rich man, poor man, upstairs, downstairs, set in El Salvador from 1932 through 1977.It is a compelling read and Sandra Benitez grabs the reader and transports her to El Salvador with the first sentence:\"The parakeets ascened in a rustling roar of wings from the amate and primavera trees. Chattering rowdily, they hailed the rising sun. They flew toward the southern sea cresting in a line of shimmering foam tha broke and then evanesced along the black volcanic shore. The birds wheeled, banking in a long graceful turn before heading back over the forest they had roosted in; they soared toward breakfast in maicillo fields twenty kilometers away. Jabbering, the birds glided and dipped over the alluvial plain furrowed by rivers and streams coming down from the highlands. Across the plain, they trailed a hasty shadow over squares of cattle ranches and rectangles of scattered farms; they sailed past the spot where four hundred years before, don Pedro de Alvarado and his conquistadores defeated the mighty arm of the Pipil. But such a victory exacted its toll for in the fierce skirmish, Alvarado took an arrow in the leg, a wound from which he would never recover.\"And that wound to the leg portends the history of the characters which inhabit Bitter Grounds. Sandra Benitez fleshes out her heroines of each generation, Elena and Mercedes, Magda and Jacinta and Florencia and Maria Mercedes. All are strong and vulnerable, wise and foolish and all are haunted by decisions that will shape their paths and those who follow them.The familiar structure of the family saga worked well to bring an understanding of the mid-twentieth century history of El Salvador. Sandra Benitez, skillfully fleshed out the intricacies of the culture, the economy and social structure of the country for a reader unfamiliar with it can gain understanding and insight, while at the same time entertaining with a wonderful story. She infused her story gracefully with small elements of magic realism which inhabit many books by Latin American authors.I would not hesitate to pick up another book by this author.",

He dominated the horror genre as the preeminent innovator of supernatural storytelling in the period between the death of Edgar Allan Poe and the rise of H.P. Lovecraft.

Reviewers appreciate the vivid descriptions and unique premise of a world where plants and animals blur together. Some readers compare the book's themes to those in the movie \"Avatar,\" noting similarities. Despite some disappointment with the author's other works, \"Midworld\" is considered a classic science fiction must-read.

Mere apes! Contemptible salad-eaters! Taking pride in sneaking up on a leaf! Obviously fit only to be lunch, not even a speed bump in the Kzinti's imperial career. Hardly worth screaming-and-leaping about. But when the feline Kzin moved in to take over the monkey-occupied worlds¾they got clobbered. The humans, with their underhanded monkey cunning, turned communications equipment and space drives into weapons that cut the dauntless Heroes into ribbons. When the humans gained a faster-than-light drive, it `vas all over but the, uh, howling. The Kzin had lost their first war ever in centuries of conquest. Still, you can't keep a good warcat down, and the Kzin have by no means given up. New weapons, new strategies, and new leaders¾the humans had better keep their powder dry.

It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise.

They couldn't have been more different then, or even today - Lincoln's a commercial real estate broker, Teddy a tiny-press publisher and Mickey an ageing musician. But each man holds his own secrets, in addition to the monumental mystery that none of them has ever stopped puzzling over since 1971: the disappearance of their friend Jacy. Now, decades later, the distant past interrupts the present as the truth about what happened to Jacy finally emerges, forcing the men to reconsider everything they thought they knew about each other. Shot through with Russo's trademark comedy and humanity, Chances Are also introduces a new level of suspense and menace that will quicken the reader's heartbeat throughout this absorbing saga of how friendship's bonds are every bit as constricting and rewarding as those of family. For both longtime fans and lucky newcomers, Chances Are is a stunning demonstration of a highly-acclaimed author deepening and expanding his remarkable body of work.",

          "comment": "Jack Kerouac was intensely alive and his fiery love of life is perhaps best captured in this wonderful book. One of the treasures of American literature, this warm and happy novel is filled with the joy and sadness that Kerouac saw in the world.A novel of this type has the unique ability to capture the living heart of a person, putting it down on the page for us all to discover. Fortunately Kerouac was an unusually kind and warm hearted man, and his strange foolhardy goodness illuminates the pages of this book like a warm glowing candle flame.The main character of the novel is Kerouac himself, but the hero is based on the character of the poet Gary Snyder. One of the wisest of the beats, Snyder has shown us all how to live through his series of fine books. To me, Snyder is a more worthy hero than Neal Cassidy, the character whom Kerouac praises in his most famous book, On the Road.It is not entirely clear why Kerouac chose to fictionalize the characters in his book, calling his hero Japhy Ryder rather than Gary Snyder. One of the most touching moments of the book comes when Kerouac, describing the time when came back to the west coast after visiting his mother, accidentally slips out of character and says that it is \"Gary\" who greeted him in the little shack in Marin County.In this book, and in later years, Snyder would have one complaint about Kerouac: he drank too much. This book perfectly captures Kerouac's wonderful spirit, putting it down on the page where it will not be forgotten for many, many years. But there is also a kind eulogistic sadness that hovers over this book. It is hard to understand how such a beautiful spirit would be so quickly snuffed out by an indulgence in alcohol.A huge amount of ink has been spilled denigrating the beats in general, Kerouac whenever possible, and this book in particular. It is extremely ironic to read it now, all these years later, and find it is still so vividly alive, while Kerouac's critics and the books they praised are now usually either hopelessly outdated or entirely forgotten. It is true that Kerouac can at times write like an angel, and can steadily write with intense vividness, and occasionally write complete nonsense. But of course Kerouac knew when he was being silly. He was clearly and perhaps admirably lost in the materialism of 1950's America, but he was no fool.Yet it is not Kerouac's prose that matters, but his amazing, intensely alive spirit. He was rapturously in love with the world and the people in it. Like Melville and Whitman, he had perfect pitch when it came to defining the casual, irreverent style that embodies the best in the American spirit. He is a modern day Ishmael, wandering the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, a refugee from the compulsive materialism of the American Ahabs who crave power so they can wreak their twisted and doomed revenge on their imagined enemies.At the heart of the book lies a meditation on Mahayana Buddhism and the emptiness of this world. Kerouac, who was full of words, sings the praises of the soundless void. And in that emptiness, he finds the compassion which forms the wellsprings of life. That compassion, and Kerouac's intense ode to the joy of living, are found on every page of this sad, beautiful book.",

I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with &quot;sez I.&quot;",

And with what relish he describes his meals, travels, fleeting meetings with other people, animals, and nature!On the other hand, I found Kerouac's interpretation of Buddhism to be rather misguided at times. A bhikku is one who commits himself to monastic discipline -- in stark contrast to Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder, who were often chasing after pleasures of the flesh.No, it is not polished, but I would prefer to focus on what I appreciated about this book: his admiration for others, his dynamic descriptions of mountain climbing, his wonderful anecdotes about food and eating (he truly had a knack for making an austere meal sound divine). So much gratitude and love of simple things, so much childlike wonder.",

I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat.

There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different.

My suspicion is, as I hinted above in my jerky little title, people hail this book because they think it makes them somehow elite and cool to proclaim a kinship to it. I think that's the key to the \"popularity\" of a lot of art, a lot of music, a lot of literature extolled by subcultures within the masses. They are bolstered by an illusion of affinity for what they secretly do not embrace. In the case of this book, at times Kerouac's prose was lovely and at other times it rambled until I had no idea what he was going on about. The concept of The Dharma Bums is exciting and if even a fraction of those who claim this novel awakened something spiritual inside them are being honest, then I respect its impact on them, but...I didn't connect with the Beat vocabulary, with the story here, or the fact that since it's probably as much invention as autobiography, it validly inspires aspirations of real life imitation.

          "comment": "Eeeha! That dharmy-boy Jack shore can smith them words. They bounce and spin, leap and unfurl in a cacophony of tremulous abandon in your mind's ear.The pleasure in reading Kerouac is that he is such a remarkably good, wonderful person and he is so joyous and full of zealotry and surprise. And he loves everyone, unconditionally. But there is not a hint of treacle; it is all vividly authentic but awash in kindness.THE DHARMA BUMS was written in the late 50s, and was a quick follow up to Kerouac's ground-breaking best-seller ON THE ROAD. Both are less experimental than others of Kerouac's works, but are jaunty displays of Kerouac's famed spontaneous prose.As with most of Kerouac's work, the novel is written in first person and closely follows events in Kerouac's life, with the identities of his real-life beat friends disguised by pseudonyms (at the insistence of his publisher).The book begins in southern California in 1955 with Ray Smith [Jack] struggling to hop a fast train to San Francisco. He arrives in The City after overcoming some difficulties and meeting a good-hearted hobo. Once in the city, there is a quick chapter--not calling much attention to itself--about Ray's attendance at a poetry reading, which is noteworthy in that it is a fictionalized account of the most famous poetry reading of all time: when Allan Ginsberg first read &quot;Howl.&quot; [In the novel the poet is named Alvah Goodbook and his poem is titled &quot;Wail.&quot;]Quickly, though, Ray [and the reader] meets the central character of the book, Japhy Ryder. [It is fun to know that Japhy is based on the Pulitzer-winning poet Gary Snyder and the project Japhy/Gary is up to at the beginning of the novel is to draft the first Chinese-to-English translation of Han Shan's &quot;Cold Mountain.&quot; Shan's epic poem is the inspiration of the current best-selling novel of the same name, set during the Civil War.] Ryder is the ultimate, ebullient frees!pirit who whisks Ray off on an adventure, a climb up the Matterhorn (a peak just outside the current-day borders of Yosemite National Monument). At all times, Japhy and Ray engage in happy dharma banter, swapping tales and lessons learned. And back at Japhy's shack of a home there are orgies, jazz and meditation, exceptionally tasty plates of beans and bottles of cheap ruby-red port.The book continues with fascinating similar events, all written in a lusty, swashbuckling style, full of dharma and comradery. At the novel's conclusion, a final mountain is climbed--both figuratively and literally--and the experience left me fully satisfied.Unlike almost all other novels, DHARMA BUMS and others of Kerouac's tales are not driven by a careful, classic plotline. There is no achy tragedy that you read your way into the heart of and then hope for a nifty, surprising conclusion. The book barrels forward from the lust-for-life of its characters and the supreme genius of Kerouac at his craft of threading words.",

From what I had heard, however, it was not something that I needed to tackle without having first read something else (and less dense) by Kerouac. So, on a whim, I bought \"The Dharma Bums\" at a local bookstore just before I went home for one weekend.As luck would have it, my car broke down at an out-of-the-way gas station, so I had some time to kill while I was waiting on a ride. I began to read...and read...and read. What I found was pure Beat genius, a zest for life, and an inward desire in myself to say \"Screw it,\" and hike the Smokies. Kerouac, with his brilliantly crafted observations, dialogue, and imagery, brings us into a universe of windy freedom and presents the world as an answer to the problems that it itself causes.If there are any problems with this novel, I'm certain that some people will get bored with some of the beautifully written, yet tedious, description and imagery. In spite of that, I recommend this book to anyone who needs a break from there mundane nine-to-fives. Read it.Maybe I'll get on with \"On the Road,\" now.",

          "comment": "The Dharma Bums, by Jack Kerouac, follows Ray Smith, a character based on Kerouac himself, through an amazing physical and spiritual journey. In the story, Smith meets Japhy Ryder, an eccentric mountaineer who is fascinated by Eastern literature and religion. Japhy inspires Smith to begin his career as a meditating, rucksack-wielding `Zen Lunatic'. Smith is led to a deeper understanding of his Buddhist faith through scaling mountains, sleeping in silent deserts, and meditating for hours on end deep in the woods. He travels all over the United States, meeting innumerable different characters as he goes and learning more and more about the truths of existence itself.What shines through in The Dharma Bums isn't so much the plot of the story, but the way in which the story is told. Jack Kerouac has a knack for making the ordinary seem extraordinary, and impressing upon the reader how something seemingly mundane could impact him in a profound way. The narrative has a wide-eyed romance about it, making every experience Ray Smith has seem new and fresh. People, places, and events in the book are described with a prose that is practically poetry, painting a vivid picture in the reader's mind. In reading The Dharma Bums, I wasn't concerned as much with what happened as I was with how it happened.The Dharma Bums isn't a book that everyone would enjoy. Some would find it pointless or long-winded, or difficult to read. For someone who likes a lot of description and feeling in a book, however, I strongly recommend it. This book is also a necessity for any enthusiast of Beat literature, and even those interested in Buddhism would appreciate it as a serious philosophical work. To anyone else, The Dharma Bums is bound to add inspiration, excitement, and a new perspective to any open mind.",

          "comment": "Just before \"On the Road\" brought him the success he craved, Kerouac wrote this account of the \"Zen Lunatics\" and Gary Snyder's prediction of a \"rucksack revolution.\" This is my first Beat book; in middle age I admit lingering distrust of their sometimes condescending attitude towards the rest of us.That being said, this novelization may make the young feel vigorous and the mature wistful. Hearing \"Japhy Ryder\" gush about bulgar and yabyum, green tea and trail mix, baked bread and paisley shawls, Goodwill and hi-fi jazz before the massive commodification of counterculture filters the innocence of these early free spirits from Eisenhower's decade into a muted sepia. It's instructive, as Ann Douglas notes in her introduction, that \"Ray\" as Kerouac strives towards a greater sympathy than Snyder-as-Japhy expresses with the \"straights\" who must, after all, fund the hikes and the naps of the Beats. There's a sense of slumming, by these two students wanting to imitate a \"bhikku,\" a dharma bum. Japhy in real life's Reed-Indiana-Berkeley, Ray's author a scholarship-dropout from Columbia, allied with other privileged folks from the Ivy League and NYC bohemia. I don't know why, but there's an aura of play-acting and noblesse-oblige irritating me about their admirable but somehow smug quest. Blame it on Berkeley?Ray appears, to his eternal credit, aware at least of the contradiction between a Zen lunatic lording his insight over the unenlightened crew-cut and bee-hived masses and his own self struggling, who down on his luck has to go back to North Carolina to live off his kinfolk. Some of the best moments in this book come when Ray tells of his tramps by train and hitchhiking.Apropos, this book was written in ten days and nights at his mother's place in Florida. As his fictional self, Ray ponders the contradiction between the San Francisco party scene of dissolute intellectuals and his family, unable to comprehend Ray's notions and his lazy habits. \"And I thought of Japhy as I stood there in the cold yard looking at {his mother as she does the dishes]: 'Why is he so mad about white tiled sinks and \"kitchen machinery\" he calls it? People have good hearts whether or not they live like Dharma Bums. Compassion is the heart of Buddhism.\" (100)Yet, the Beats' stance against conformity did inspire generations towards more righteous behavior, along with a lot of excess on that road to wisdom. It's noteworthy that the narrator opens by admitting that while he was once more devout before he met Ryder, now he's \"a little tired and cynical.\" (2) Ray seems already to have studied the dharma largely on his own and passed through the initial, somewhat superior stage, and now feels it's a lot of \"lip service.\" Still, meeting Japhy, Ray perks up.The centerpiece of the narrative, the climb of the Matterhorn, makes one compare that Sierra peak to the manufactured scale mold towering in smaller form above the then-new Disneyland further south in California. The impression of a still largely rural state, even around the Bay Area, leaves a sense of loss for those who live in the state now. The Beats and then hippies, no less than Cold War defense industries, transformed California into a busier, tawdrier, and uglier place, with dreamers and schemers lured by the rhapsodies in Kerouac and Snyder and their mates.Unable to stay in the South with his family, inarticulate in sharing with them his understanding of Buddhist dharma, Ray goes back after bumming it along the Mexican border just as he left, back west to work as a Cascadia fire-warden at Desolation Peak's lookout. There, as the story ends, he finds his expected peace. \"I made raspberry Jello the color of rubies in the setting sun.\" (183) The interim return to California, full of parties in Marin, as with the previous woozy bashes in San Francisco, does drag the momentum down for long stretches of this short book. The contrasts between boho decadence and natural purity may be intentional, but the wobbly, hungover funk does hobble the pace. The comparisons between energy and dissipation do, on the other hand, underscore the lesson of impermanence, even of happy times, and the necessity for self-discipline.Japhy reminds Ray of the change coming when more people join their refusal to conform. \"East'll meet West anyway. Think what a great world revolution will take place when East meets West finally, and it'll be guys like us that can start the thing. Think of millions of guys all over the world with rucksacks on their backs tramping around the back country and hitchhiking and bringing the word down to everybody.\" (155)Kerouac here's still young enough-- even if nearly a decade past Snyder-- to hope. \"Something will come of it in the Milky Way of eternity stretching in front of all our phantom misunderstandings, friends. I felt like telling Japhy everything I thought but I knew it didn't matter and moreover he knew it anyway and silence is the golden mountain.\" (53) This typical passage captures the tone of the novel-as-memoir. Based as Douglas notes on smart predecessors like Thomas Wolfe, Melville, Dostoyevsky, Joyce, and C&eacute;line, Kerouac sought an admirable purity in his style. It may be difficult for us half-a-century later, jaded, to hear its freshness, but its sincerity lingers in moments such as when he tells us of the moon on water as they descended the mountain on a dark night. \"Everything up there had smelled of ice and snow and heartless spine rock. Here there was the smell of sun-heated wood, sunny dust resting in the moonlight, lake mud, flowers, straw, all those good things of the earth.\" (68-69) This may not be the more manic Kerouac that made him famous, but it may give today's uneasy riders a more lasting lesson in the legacy he left us.(P.S. Also see my review of \"Wake Up! A Life of the Buddha,\" written by Kerouac in 1955, published in 2008.)",

Most who don't care for it complain that there is a shadow of commercialism hanging over it because after the success of ON THE ROAD, his publisher asked specifically for something \"like ON THE ROAD\" and so he delivered THE DHARMA BUMS. As if this single fact (even if true, which I somehow doubt) has any bearing on the quality of the writing or the success of how Kerouac expressed the ideas within the work.To me, it is one of the most successful of Kerouac's novels. The writing is extremely powerful and seems to echo after you put the book away. I also find it to be the most transporting of his books--there is a feeling of almost being in some of the places he describes. In this way, as far as place, it's more effective than his more well-known and widely admired pieces.This novel means a lot to me. It never fails to inspire me, and I often take a copy along when I go backpacking into a National Park or wilderness area.",

They meet other Buddhists, drink wine, talk about Buddhist stuff like the Diamond Sutra, Bhoddisatvas and Bhikkhus, past Buddhas, and they write a lot of haiku poems. All the while, the narrator is constantly bombarding the reader with his strange Buddhist revelations he comes to while praying like \"everything is empty but awake\", or \"rocks are space and space is illusion\". It gets old fast.Ray Smith reminds me of a less-cool Dude from \"The Big Lebowski\".You won't find any fascinating stories that Sal Paradise (\"On the Road\") had of meeting new people wherever he went, jazz clubs and drinking too much, the drugs, the sexual encounters of the women he entertained... nothing.",

The innocence, the lack of pretention, the sincerity - it is so totally alien from what this society has become. Sure Jack Kerouac had his problems with booze and relationships, but at his core there was somehow this absolutely blinding glare of innocent purity. Here was a man whose primary concerns were always the meaning of life, the nature of god, the suffering of innocents, whether he was boozing it up in a bar, hopping a freight, or hold up in a look-out cabin on top of a mountain. Jack Kerouac was a true poet in a world were poetry was in abysmal decline both before and after. Jack Kerouac's life was a spontaneous living poem- the dionysian poem of the living holy fool._This is my favorite of all Kerouac's novels. I've had people comment about how I must have patterned a huge part of my early life on this book. I remember thinking so too, except all my wandering and wondering took place before I even heard of Jack or his books....",

          "comment": "Some of the general points made below have been used in other reviews of books and materials by and about Jack Kerouac.\"As I have explained in another entry in this space in a DVD review of the film documentary \"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\", recently I have been in a \"beat\" generation literary frame of mind. I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on one of Jack Kerouac's major works, \"The Dharma Bums\", a novel that explores his and his `beat\" companions fascination, at least part time fascination, with the Buddhist lifestyle and philosophy in his well known spontaneous writing method at a time when he was trying to keep body and soul together, that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have had more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of Kerouac's better known works dedicated to Lowell's `bad boy', the \"king of the 1950s beat writers\".And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then, \"On The Road\", his classic modern physical and literary `search' for the meaning of America for his generation which came of age in post-World War II , readily comes to mind. No so well known, however, is the fact that that famous youthful novel was merely part of a much grander project, an essentially autobiographical exposition by Kerouac in many volumes starting from his birth in 1922, to chart and vividly describe his relationship to the events, great and small, of his times. Those volumes bear the general title \"The Legend Of Duluoz\". That is why we today, in the year of the forty anniversary of Kerouac's death, are under the sign of his book of essays \"The Dharma Bums\".In a sense, as Kerouac himself often admitted, his fascination with Buddhism was something of an extension of his Gallic-etched Catholicism. That makes sense in that both religious expressions are filled with ritual and intense mystery. Thus, when Jack went west in the mid1950s to San Francisco and hooked up with the likes of poet Gary Snyder who was already a serious student of that religion/philosophical outlook it was natural that the restless Kerouac and the others would be attracted to this form of life, although it probably was, in the end, far too rigorous for Kerouac with his many earthy appetites. Nevertheless, this book presents that lifestyle and the youthful search for fulfillment that this searching represented in a very positive light and proved to be helpful to him in getting through some rough patches. Allen Ginsberg, a very close Kerouac friend at the time, became, for a while, a devotee of more substance and notoriety. However, and here we get back to the political realities, when the deal went down that religious philosophy could not hold up against the harsh political choices of the late 1960s when things got very \"hot\" in America, and the world.",

The themes are drastically different also, On the Road being a sensualist's dream, and Dharma Bums being the down to earth maturity that came from years of living on the road. Nature is a key factor in the book, its no Walden but the way Kerouac intertwines nature, Buddhism and the American dream is a very entertaining read. I would recommend this book over On the Road simply because it is shorter and blends a variety of things that are uncommonly seen together. The only difficulty was having to look up a few terms in regard to the eastern religions, but even that doesn't detract from the flow of the book. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked On the Road, and if you haven't read any Kerouac, this is a good place to start.",

I was never sure where they were going to go next. The payoff for me was near the end, where he heads up to Washington state, ultimately arriving at his fire lookout on remote Desolation Peak in the North Cascades. That's not far from my house, and though much has changed since the '50s, a lot of his description of the trip from Seattle up to the mountain still rings true today.

In Dharma Bums the wilderness he explores is the desolate mountains of California. At the beginning he sets ouf with his friend Japhy, and some other climber named Morley, to take on the precarious task of hiking a mountain called Matterhorn, and later Ray spends almost two months in solitude as a fire lookout on a mountain he calls &quot;Desolation.&quot;While at times I became peeved at Kerouac's (or Ray's) somewhat childish Buddhist ramblings, I began to realize that it was this unfettered exuberance with life that is utterly lacking in the seriousness of our business oriented society with its somber goal to mechanize human life.We hear very little of Neal Cassady (Cody in this book), who was the maniacal force that hurled On The Road along, with the exception of the scene in which Ray watches Cody's girlfriend Rosie who later commits suicide the morning after Ray tells her, in response to her paranoid rambling, &quot;But you're getting these silly convictions and conceptions out of nowhere, don't you realize all this life is just a dream? Why don't you just relax and enjoy God? God is you, you fool!&quot; Unfortunately I'm not too sure his consolation mitigated her paranoia about reality but you can't blame Ray's sincere attempt to help. The sytle of this novel is less plot and more sensory perceptions, which are captured in Kerouac's magnificant prosaic style.Oh, one more thing. The book opens with Jack hopping out of a freight &quot;somewhere near Camarillo,&quot; which is the city I live in. I think that's one of the many reasons why I am drawn to his novels. He lived and experienced America more than most of the American citizens who claim that Kerouac was a dissident while it was his dissidence that really proved how much he loved and felt for the U.S.",

I did this not only because its rough-cut pages make the book a wonder to handle, but because I think it's imperative for any devotee of American literature to read.Jack Kerouac envisioned that his many books would ultimately form a self-contained, complete volume which all linked together, an autobiography he entitled the \"Duluoz Legend.\"He writes, \"The whole thing forms one enormous comedy, seen through they eyes of poor Ti Jean (me), otherwise known as Jack Duluoz, the world of raging action and folly and also of gentle sweetness seen through the keyhole of his eye.\"Kerouac's more frequently read \"On the Road\" showcases his innovation of spontaneous prose through a frenetic story that glorifies what is arguably immoral rebellious behavior. \"The Dharma Bums,\" set about seven years later, again utilizes his madcap writing style, but in a way much more accessible to the reader than many of his other works. For how they snub conventional grammar and syntax, \"The Subterraneans,\" \"Big Sur,\" and \"Satori in Paris\" are dizzying.\"The Dharma Bums,\" however, expands into a commentary on Zen Buddhism through a sort of travelogue that chronicles Kerouac's meditations and wanderings through nature. It's a modernist adaptation of the works of the roaming poets of ancient Japan, most notable among them Matsuo Basho. Here Kerouac effortlessly glides past the preconceived notions of what form literature is supposed to take, and in so doing, with his melodic prosody, he renders a reading experience that is vivid and transcendent.",

There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!",

          "comment": "In The Dharma Bums, Jack Kerouac continues his enthralling series of autobiographical fictions that he referred to as the Legend of Duluoz. His altar egos have several different names, such as Sal Paradise (On the Road), and in this novel, Ray Smith. Through Ray Smith, Kerouac tells of a chapter in his life that, even more than On The Road, displays his passion for living and idealistic approach to life, as well as to Buddhism. Ray Smith is not a hardcore Zen Buddhist, but an optimist who embraces the very best of Zen Buddhism, as well as Tibetan Buddhism and even Christianity. The novel does not consist of plot, but rather a series of entertaining vignettes and scraps of story that form a beautiful mosaic by novel's end. With sometimes raw, sometimes stunningly beautiful language, Kerouac transports the reader to the peak of the Matterhorn, across the country from California to North Carolina on a hitchhiking odyssey, to the beat poetry scene in San Francisco, to the ultimate destination, Desolation Peak, where Ray Smith truly finds himself. Within the novel is a cornucopia of interesting, colorful characters that do not leave the memory easily. The Dharma Bums is a book not to be read, but to be inhaled, drunk, savored and treasured.",

Kerouac's Dharma Bums was always one of his novels that depending on my current state I either like it or was bored. Reading this on a plane ride to Los Angeles, California it left me cold.As always the book feels positive and is writing with excellent style, passion, and literary craftsmanship. It is inspiring and refreshing to read a piece about someone in search of bettering their spirituality while still being able to not pass judgement on others.That is all great, but honestly this lags. The extent of detail placed on minor things that really don't effect the plot by any stretch create boring passages. This is the only Kerouac that ever bored me and it bores me to no extent.While he wrote from his own experiences it seems to me that he sometimes became lost in something that was really only interesting to him at the time. As honest and heartfelt as that is that doesn't make it any more entertaining.",

          "comment": "THE DHARMA BUMS is Kerouac's mostly autobiographical 1958 follow-up to the iconic ON THE ROAD. And, truth be known, THE DHARMA BUMS, though less known, is a far better tale than its predecessor, which embraced a rough and gritty depravity as the Beat metier.In THE DHARMA BUMS, Ray Smith (Kerouac) sets out for California where he meets Japhy Ryder (the poet Gary Snyder), who introduces him to the essences of Zen Buddhism, as well as the core of what was to become the counterculture of the 1960s.Kerouac's gentle, wide-eyed amazement at the spiritual world he has entered is manifest on every page. Whether in a North Frisco crash pad or in the Sierras, Kerouac moves through a joyous universe full of light, color, and sheer new-ness. His ability to share his inner visions on these pages marks him as a truly talented writer. THE DHARMA BUMS is a happy book. Even Kerouac's occasional bouts with alcohol and depression do not detract from the experience, they merely underscore the happiness and the heights to be found in Zen spiritual practice.There's a lot to like about this book, and I really do. For anyone who cares to make the journey, THE DHARMA BUMS is a great (if unfocused) primer on Zen that needs to be read for the simple pleasure of it.",

          "comment": "Jack Kerouac is one of those artists, musicians, or writers who I get really into for a while, then don't occupy my time with their works, but always come back to them at some point. I read On the Road around 6-7 years ago and afterward quickly read Big Sur and Visions of Girard. Over the past few years though, I thought maybe I had grown out of him. So when my Dad recently gave me a City Lights gift certificate for Christmas, I made a mental note that I'd like to see if I still liked Jack Kerouac or not. I found a neat copy of The Dharma Bums that I had never seen before, so I grabbed it.Dharma Bums is my favorite Kerouac book so far. As with On the Road, I found his writing to be very evocative; scenery, places, but especially the people Jack comes across in his adventures really come to life. As with his other works, Kerouac calls refers to himself by another name, and in The Dharma Bums he is known as Ray Snyder. The other protagonist is Zen poet Gary Snyder, or Japhy Ryder as he is known here. Dharma Bums starts off \"Ray\" and \"Japhy\" and friends hanging out in the Bay Area, and recounts the now-legendary night Allen Ginsburg first recited \"Howl\" during the heyday of the \"San Francisco Renaissance.\" He also briefly goes over an odd sort of orgy at Japhy's Berkeley house, where all Ray felt comfortable doing was licking some girl's elbows and arms. I have to admit I had just come home from a happy hour when I read the first 30 pages, so that part is kind of fuzzy in my memory.Following this, the book recalls their trip up the Matterhorn, a large mountain in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. This was the highlight of the book for me. I felt like I was right there with Ray, Japhy, and their friend Morley who forgot to bring a sleeping bag for the freezing trek, but insisted on bringing an air mattress for him to sleep on. One thing about Kerouac's book is that you can really tell he loves the company of his friends and people he meets on the road. I can't ever recall reading a bad thing about anyone in any of his books. I think a large part of the reason I like reading his books so much is that I appreciate his sincere joy he finds from people and nature. Others might call it navet&eacute;, but bullocks to them.Following the Matterhorn expedition, Ray leaves to visit his Mom in North Carolina. He hops trains, takes the bus, and hitchhikes across the country. There's the guy from Ohio he meets near the Mexican border, and the fun they have when they make an excursion across the border. In North Carolina one gets the sense that Ray isn't appreciated by his family that much. He tries to explain Buddhism and they laugh him off. I couldn't help but feel bad for him. His mom seems nice, but she is never really developed that well.Every day he went into the woods to meditate and cavort with the animals. I think that's probably what I would be doing too.After his return to CA, he is about to take a summer job as a fire lookout in Washington State's Desolation Peak, on Japhy's recommendation. Likewise, Japhy is about to head to Japan to live at a Buddhist monastery. Being Ray and Japhy however, you know there has to be some serious partying before they leave. They are staying in Corte Madera, and there are wild parties every night, usually involving copious amounts of alcohol and people dancing naked. Japhy and Ray sneak out a few days before Japhy is scheduled to leave, and go on a final trek through Marin County wilderness. Japhy leaves and everyone is sad.The final part of TDB is Ray making his way up to Washington. The strangers he meets are usually nice, with the exception of the Oregon cowboy who purposely runs over Ray's hat on the road. He briefly covers his time as a fire lookout, but I'm sure Desolation Angels goes into much more detail. That will be the next Kerouac book I read. There are a lot of Buddhist themes, prayers, and sayings throughout the book (hence the title.) While that might turn some readers off, I enjoyed it. Buddhism is something that has interested me for quite some time. It's sad that Jack didn't find what he was looking for. The bottle turned out to be his salvation - and demise.",

          "comment": "I think that The Dharma Bums is probably Kerouac's best novel. It has all the exitement and electricity of On the Road, plus a lot of Buddhist instrospection and meditation. This is Kerouac at his best. He had mastered his craft, and had yet to slip into alcoholism and self destruction. In fact Kerouac does have a sweetness and innocence and a love of life, of nature, of dharma; and it makes me sad to think of what became of him later. One might get the wrong idea about Buddhism. Kerouac and his buddies spend a lot of time drinking wine and smoking tea which really doesn't go very well with Buddhist practice. But they were truly pioneers as there were very few Buddhist teachers and no Buddhist practice centers in the US. They either had to invent their own form of Buddhism (as Kerouac did) or go to Asia. One thing this book has in common with On the Road is that it does involve a lot of travel. He journeys northward from southern California to San Francisco in a boxcar. Then travels across country to stay with his sister in North Carolina where he meditates and prays in the woods. And the book closes with a journey north to Washington state instead of south the Mexico as On The Road does. Instead of Neal Cassady we have Gary Snyder as Kerouac's friend. Finally, after a series of adventures in the bay area and on a back packing trip with a character whom I believe is based on Kerouac's friend Philip Whalen, Snyder departs for a zen monestary in Japan (he wouldn't return from Asia until the mid sixties and the two friends never saw each other again). Its a bit ironic that Allen Ginsburg (Goldberg in the novel) was initially skeptical of the Buddhist teachings but later became more devoted to it than Kerouac, becoming a diciple of the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa. Whalen became a zen priest and lived for years at the San Francisco Zen Center. But this was Kerouac at his peak. His most blissful and holy. His golden dream of life in the Buddhalands.",

The casual reader delights in reading about Kerouac and Snyder climbing the Matterhorn; the same holds true for Teh Kerouac/ Cassady relationship in On the Road. Still I think that the underlying truths of this book, which lie dormant to the casual reader, greatly outshine the aciton.Kerouac's prose aims to draw the reader away from the worldly cycle of Work-Consume-Work-Consume and so on. He aims to show us a different path, one for the people who meditate and defy social convention, not simply for the sake of defiance, but for the sake of self-enlightenment.The long-haired, tea smoking, judge killing, terrorist supporting outsiders of today, so villified by the present and past governments, find in Kerouac much overlooked philosophy a separate peace, one away from the wired up fast paced world of dead technology. When Kerouac goes on his long beautiful tangents about children singing a ditty of their own imagination, it's like being eight years old again and having ice cream and cookies in the kitchen and laughing about the nonsense that happened at school that day. Kerouac reminds us that we do not live in a world enclosed by the suggested rule of society, that we are each our own to create and experience what we will for ourselves.TTFNDr. Gonzo",

Their daily surroundings are often magnificent as they also come to terms with a country where affluence and poverty exist uncanningly side by side. Underling the often traumatic events is Polly's fledgling relationship.

          "comment": "Everyone knows that sequels are usually not as good as the original, which is certainly the case with SHADOWER by Catherine Spangler. A sci-fi romance, SHADOWER was written after the award-winning SHIELDER to explain the history behind the beautiful merchant Moriah and her bounty-hunter husband, Sabin. So, SHADOWER (the sequel) takes place before SHIELDER (the prequel), timeline-wise. SHADOWER had also been a book I was anxious to read, simply because I thought both Moriah and Sabin were fascinating characters. Their story, however, was not as good as Chase and Nessa's in SHIELDER.The first chapter in SHADOWER in which Moriah and Sabin meet at a seedy bar on a nasty planet was interesting. However, once Moriah stows away on his ship and they begin their cat-and-mouse game of \"catch me if you can,\" I started to lose interest, mostly because of how the characters are portrayed. The Moriah that interested me in SHIELDER was tough yet exceptionally feminine. Here in SHADOWER, she's portrayed as a man-hating victim. The victim part bugged me the most. The last thing I wanted to read about was somebody's stark terror at being touched intimately by any man. Plus, it ruined my image of Moriah, seeing her as a clich&eacute; of victimhood. Same thing with Sabin. In SHIELDER, he was this ultra-cool bounty hunter who was rough and tough, yet was secretly protecting his people from the brink of extinction. In SHADOWER, he ends up fumbling every attempt to capture Moriah, who wrongs him in so many ways. It made him look bad - how's he supposed to be an effective bounty hunter if one woman can slip his grasp every time he meets up with her? It also becomes quite clear that he is one of the most whipped heroes that ever existed. Every bad thing Moriah does to him is justified by her victimhood status, which he decides to help her overcome. Oh come on!There is a very similar sci-fi romance out there called THE SKYPIRATE, which was written 5 years before SHADOWER and reads so much better. Both stories are about heroes who fly around in space ships doing supposed bad deeds but are, in reality, actually supporting the existence of their persecuted peoples. Both stories also have heroines who were former sex slaves and have baggage because of it. However, SKYPIRATE is much more enjoyable because, while there is baggage, it doesn't overwhelm the story and doesn't stereotype the heroine into a victim.Also, SKYPIRATE doesn't use a lot of American jargon or phrasing, like SHADOWER does. In SHADOWER, characters ask each other if they are \"OK\" or say things like \"you hated my guts.\" This is supposed to be a sci-fi set on other planets. They shouldn't talk like Americans in the 21st century.Anyway, while SHADOWER was disappointing, I still intend to read the next book in the series, called SHAMARA. Hopefully, it'll be on par with the first book, SHIELDER, which was such a fantastic romance.",

          "comment": "While I certainly enjoyed the first book in this series, Chloe, I was delighted to find that Bette was a much better novel than the first! Bette does not feel as hastily written, and it does not jerk the reader around the way its predecessor often did.The first third of the book, while entertaining, is a bit sappy and everything seems a little too \"perfect\". However, I believe the author was trying to mirror the innocence of the main character, because, as Bette grows more worldly and independent, the writing grows up right along with her, and before you know it, you are wrapped up in an intelligent, exciting, and surprising story that you did not expect! I grew to love Bette more than I did her mother Chloe, perhaps because Bette showed more realistic faults, and a distinct pattern of growth. In the end, I was left feeling very proud of Bette, and hungry for the next book in the series!Once again, Lyn Cote did a wonderful job of illustrating the historical aspects of the story. She has a distinct talent for \"transporting\" her readers to another time and place.Just as with the first novel in this series, I don't feel that this book is necessarily a \"Christian\" novel, as it is often touted as being. However, I do think this book had more references to God than the last one did, and they feel more natural than the few references that were thrown in to Chloe.Overall, a very enjoyable book that I would most definitely recommend to others!",

A reporter she's been working with has the plates but the thugs worry about what he knows and take matters into their own hands to silence him forever.John and Esther try to figure it all out.WHAT I LIKED:The research was impeccable, and the epilogue is a nice touch to separate fact from fiction. The writing is first-rate and the settings are alive with the time. Each image portrays the world of the time, and the reader is transported easily with each page.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:A couple of small nit-picky points -- there area a lot of characters, which can be a problem to track in mystery stories, but they are sufficiently different here that they don't run together as much. A few of the characters (such as the reporter) were fleshed out a little TOO much, but I'm assuming part of that was with a view to them showing up in future stories too.THE BOTTOM LINE:One of the best historical mysteries I have ever read, and one of the better mysteries period. 4.50 lilypads out of 5.00.Other Information:- Source: New- Original date of review: February 2001, updated 2011- Tags: Fiction, Prose, Historical, Action, Crime, Legal, Mystery, Amateur Detective, Police",

I had misjudged two (perhaps three) characters, but I came to see that they weren't as bad as I had thought.First of all, I thought Giles was a selfish jerk. However, he & Maggie had a communication problem. She also seemed to have something of a martyr complex, not asking for nor accepting help and misunderstanding her mother-in-law's innocent actions for a long time. Finally she spoke up and shared her fears and concerns, to learn that Giles was more of a \"new man\" than she had thought and that Paddy was \"a star.\" HOWEVER, I must say that I'm aghast that she was so cavalier about preparing for childbirth/motherhood. She & Giles should have been at the classes, no matter what he said. More than that, however, I cannot believe that she drank during her pregnancy and afterwards while she was nursing Lucia. Didn't she know that that could have had dire effect on her child (surely she has heard of fetal alcohol syndrome!). I am surprised at her parents. A first, possibly an only, grandchild deserved a little time off work to enjoy the little one. I know I would have done so.Roxanne reminds me of the song Saving All My Love for You. She had sacrificed six years of her life for a man who would never leave his wife until her childbearing years had virtually ended. But at least she did learn that he really loved her with the legacy he bequeathed to her and with his desire to spare her the pain of watching him die. But perhaps she can have the life she deserves on Cyprus with Nico.Candice had a full-blown martyr complex, which allowed the psychopathic Heather to take over her life with the full intention of destroying her for her father's sins. I take a little issue with her attitude toward Ed at first. She was definitely holier than thou with him. And her attitude toward her mother wasn't much better. Didn't she realize how much her mother must have suffered? She deserved a little understanding from her daughter. I must say, though, she was right about Justin!As I said, it was a quick read, but it lacked the humor and whimsy of the Shopaholic books and Housekeeper.",

Grand space battles with high technology and heroism.The third novel drags out, and is basically a bad novella that reveals the villain's plans (Mr. X storyline is one star) stacked ontop a mediocre planetary expedition (***). (Later Weber would redo the 'stranded planetary empire's heir' idea right withMarch Upcountryand sequels.) Scenes are constantly cut off at the good parts, giving the reader a feeling Weber had to hit a deadline and slapped everything together. Basically the third novel is fragmented and slapdash, but you do see more of the characters from the first books.Overall, I liked the first couple enough to say I liked the collection. It's a good deal despite a lackluster book three, especially if you ignore/skim the Mr. X content.",

          "comment": "As some others have pointed out, this is NOT actually a new novel; it's a re-release omnibus of three older Weber books: Mutineer's Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire (i.e. the Dahak trilogy). Thus, it's similar to The Stars at War and those that have read these novels shouldn't expect to see anything new. That said, this trilogy represents some of Weber's best work. It's classic space opera at its best: starships the size of moons, sentient computers, cyborg enhancement, antimatter warheads- never a dull moment. As is typical with Weber's work, there's more plot twists than you can count and enough visceral action to keep you begging for more. In fact, this series does leave some loose ends, and I'm holding out hope that the author may revisit it someday.Of special interest is Heirs of Empire, parts of which are clearly an early incarnation of Weber's recent Safehold series. This isn't to say that any of these novels are clones; they're quite unique and a superb example of world-building and creative storytelling- as one would expect. As always, Weber creates memorable characters that you can really relate to and will actually care about- one way or another. The plot is gripping; a genuine page-turner, not the typical half utterly boring setup that fills way too much sci-fi out there. Generally speaking, if you're getting towards the midpoint of any of the books in this collection, make sure you have a LOT of time before you continue. You just won't want to stop, and you won't be able to sleep because of it; I'm not exaggerating in the least.Now, I never do this, but I'm going to have to make an exception in this case. The missing star is not at all related to the writing; that is definitely top notch material. It's due to Baen's binding. This is a really hefty book; it rivals a typical leather-bound Bible in size and weight. It also has the lousiest cover and binding I've seen in anything of this size, and after getting about two hundred pages into it the book literally fell apart on me. I actually ended up with about ten separate chunks of pages, and read the last half of the omnibus with the first half literally missing from between the covers.Lousy quality manufacture aside, Empire from Ashes is definitely worth picking up if you have not yet had the pleasure of reading Weber's Dahak saga.",

These novels are among Weber's earliest works.Before Honor Harrington there was Commander Colin Maclntyre, USN. On a routine training mission to the moon, he discovered that the Moon wasn't a natural body, but rather a 3000 kilometer diameter warship, the Dahak. Moreover, the artificial intelligence that guided the ship had been waiting patiently -- 51,000 years -- for a crew, so it immediately impressed Colin as its commander.In Mutineers' Moon, Colin has to fight the original mutiny as well as human terrorists and fanatics. Moreover, there were the long lost empire itself.In The Armageddon Inheritance, Colin must fight against an invasion of genocidal aliens, the Achuultani. These aliens periodically swarm through the galaxy exterminating all other races. Earth can't resist them, so Colin searches the long lost empire for assistance.In Heirs of Empire, Colin's children are shipwrecked during their midshipman cruise on a primitive planet, where they face an implacable theocracy that wants them dead. Meanwhile, back in the capital, an unknown enemy is threatening the empire.These novels are space opera, of the \"find a starship and see the galaxy\" variety, with simple plots but lots of action. The scope of these novels is much like the Lensman series, huge fleets fighting in space, but without the colliding planets. Moreover, the technology is more generic and less detailed than in the Honor Harrington series.Recommended for Weber fans and anyone who enjoys largescale space opera.",

Venus Johnston has a great job, a beautiful home, and a loving live-in boyfriend named Clint, who happens to be a drop-dead gorgeous doctor. She also has a weekly beauty-parlor date with Tina, who keeps Venus's long, processed hair slick and straight. But when Clint--who's been reluctant to commit over the past four years--brings home a puppy instead of an engagement ring, Venus decides to give it all up. She trades in her long hair for a dramatically short, natural cut and sends Clint packing. It's a bold declaration of independence--one that has effects she never could have imagined. Reactions from friends and coworkers range from concern to contempt to outright condemnation. And when Clint moves on and starts dating a voluptuous, long-haired beauty, Venus is forced to question what she really wants out of life. With wit, resilience, and a lot of determination, she finally learns what true happiness is--on her own terms. Told with style, savvy, and humor, Nappily Ever After is a novel that marks the debut of a fresh new voice in fiction.",

Yes, she decides to get rid of the long, chemically relaxed hair that keeps her glued to the hair stylist chair every week or two just for maintenance. At a MINIMUM of $30.00 per style it's an expensive habit to support. And of course, her hair stylist isn't too happy that she's considering that option..you know the one of I don't need you anymore.

Mind you we're paying but we have to wait at their beck and call.So when Venus decides to break loose from the hair/salon bondage she realizes that there are other shackles that she needs to let go as well...including the 6' plus, live-in honey, lover of the last 3 years named Clint...and did I mention that he was even a so-called good catch...yes the brother Clint was a soon-to-be fully licensed doctor. Clint's problem was that he wasn't ready for commitment with Venus; afterall he figured there was another alternative rather than offering a marriage proposal. Which left Venus with no other choice but to dump him. After lonely nites and days, Venus questions whether or not she has made the right decision and whether she should allow the noncommittal Clint back into her life. After all was he really that bad...loneliness will sometimes take us to desperate measures and make us rethink our best decisions. However, the getting back might not be as easy as Venus envisioned. As we experience the antics and scenes of Venus' whirlwind life without Clint and with Clint we see an evolution of sorts as Venus gains understanding of the new Venus and that its not really the hair that matters but the person beneath the crowning glory.Nappily Ever After is a well-written debut novel; Thomas delivers a witty, funny and sensitive coming-of-age novel. Trisha Thomas is a talented newcomer and I hope to see more works from this sista! Nappily Ever After is a good read and one that makes for great discussion...why not read it today and don't forget to suggest it to your bookclub.Yasmin Coleman apooo@yahoogroups.com",

Excellent.I'll start with Clint even though he's not the main character. He should have been. Nappily Ever After shows the pain and frustration of a young black man just trying to make a way for himself. He never signed on to be the dream man of Venus jor Kandi for that matter. He wanted to be a doctor. The job of husband, and dream keeper he didn't sign on for. I loved the truth of the story. Sometimes truth is crazier than fiction. Tisha Thomas tells the truth and dazzles it with a little fiction. Venus and Kandi both had their own agendas, neither cared too much about how Clint felt in the long run.Giving this book five stars isn't enough. I wish there were other options. Recommended highly for grown folks as well as young. Ten stars!!",

I enjoyed Ms. Thomas' writing and the tack she took on the subject without losing the characters or being too heavy handed with social commentary.

Some centuries from now, the exploration and exploitation of the Solar System is in full swing. On the cold edge of the system, Bella Lind, captain of the huge commercial spacecraft Rockhopper IV, helps fuel this new gold rush by attaching mass-driver motors to organic-rich water-ice comets to move them back to the inner worlds. Her crew are tough, blue-collar miners, engineers and demolition experts. Around Saturn, something inexplicable happens: one of the moons leaves its orbit and accelerates out of the Solar System. The icy mantle peels away to reveal that it was never a moon in the first place, just a parked spacecraft, millions of years old, that has now decided to move on. Rockhopper IV, trapped in the pull, is hurled across time and space into the deep, distant future, arriving in a vast, alien-constructed chamber. And the crew are not alone, for each chamber contains an alien culture dragged into this cosmic menagerie at the end of time. The crew of the Rockhopper IV know a lot about blowing up comets, but not much about first contact with ultra-advanced aliens. They have two things to worry about: can they (and their new alien allies) negotiate their way through each harrying contact? And can they assimilate the avalanche of knowledge about their own future - including all the glittering, dangerous technologies that are now theirs for the taking - without destroying themselves in the process?",

It kept you guessing as to what would happen; the plot twists and ending were unexpected; the relationship between Bella and Svetlana was a complex balancing act of power, back and forth. I liked the aliens, which seemed fresh and original. The framing story was also different.Also, this book is a stand-alone book, and I think that Reynolds deserves special credit for that: you don't have to hunt down a lot of extra volumes. In a publishing world of open-ended series and never ending sequels, this book provides a lot of ideas, dynamic characters, and big-punch adventures in a single volume. Bravo, Alastair!!!",

The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies.",

          "comment": "There are a number of reviews which address both the \"sci\" and the \"fi\" of the novel and many which explain the premise and progression of the story. So I'm going to be brief and add an observation I don't think has been brought to the evaluation of the book. Yes, it's space opera. Yes, it addresses the near and far distant future and yes it includes a number of interactions with aliens. Interactions I found to be fascinating and plausible.My point here is that all of these things are revealed through the evolution of the love/hate relationship of the two women who are the windows through which these events are viewed. It's the \"war\" not the tech or the aliens, or even the time in space that is the real vehicle for the story of the Rockhopper. Whose perspective is the right one? How are the other officers and crew supposed to decide who or what to believe and to choose? Who will ultimately prove to be \"right\" or \"wrong\" and how do you restart a society if what you've left behind may never be regained and you really have no idea what the future may hold? Oh..... and how far do you follow leaders who make decisions you question when it's the good of the whole group that is still really at stake?Speaking as a woman who has had deep and long-lasting friendships that have been greatly tested by time and events I can tell you that love and hate both come from depth of feeling and it's not always easy to determine if what's necessary is also what's right. Do you trust the Fountainheads because Bella does? Do you take a chance on the Musk Dogs because Svieta so completely mistrusts Bella's decision-making process? Because in the end, the crew had made choices about who they believed and the \"who is good and who is bad\" played out through those filters.First contact will be made by individuals who may be in that position for any number of reasons. For that matter, the whole of human history has played out on the backs of those who made the big decisions, those who carried them out and the ones who wrote about it later.For good or ill, at it's heart, Pushing Ice is about people and a series of life-altering events as they experienced them and I enjoyed it immensely.But that's also just my opinion and I won't be exiling anyone who disagrees!",

          "comment": "This was a decent book by a great sci-fi author, Alastair Reynolds. Reynolds is one of my favorite sci-fi writers, one of those in the vanguard of re-defining space opera with his Revelation Space series. The RS series is vast, mind-blowing sci-fi, crammed with hard science and the social evolution of human society alongside new technologies. It is in my opinion as good as sci-fi gets. Pushing Ice is the second novel by Reynolds that is not part of the RS space opera. It bears his trademark hard science approach to science fiction and is a memorable tale of comet cowboys retasked to rendevous with an alien artifact exiting the solar system. The ice miners then \"accidently\" get sucked out of our solar system trapped in the wake of the alien, moon-sized, spacecraft.The story follows how the several hundred ice-miners, shut-off from earth space and essentially marooned on the equivalent of a deserted isle, must come to grips with each other, their permanent isolation, and the loss of everyone and everything they have ever known, while at the same time trying to forge a dicey and bleak existence. Friendships are tried, a mutiny ensues, and the nascent society is polarized into opposing camps with long-running enmities. Enmities which fester even through building a new society, first contact with alien society, and stunning revelations that the tiny band of humans must confront as they progress in space and time.While this is a good story and a worthy, enjoyable read, I cannot say that I enjoyed it as much as the RS series and I suspect there is one reason why. In the RS series Reynolds creates multiple technologies which foster multiple societies over many star systems. This is a vast canvas upon which to paint ideas, and create, create, create. In Pushing Ice we have a micro-society with extremely limited resources who have neither the human or scientific capital to create mind-blowing societies driven by mind-blowing technologies. The story here is driven inter-personal rivalries more than science and while this creates an interesting story, in the end it simply can't compare to the inspiring visions Reynolds creates which he sets his hand to macro space opera rather than micro science fiction.If you have read the RS series and need an enjoyable science fiction fix then treat yourself to this one. It's a good story, with the occasional gem, such as the slogan: \"We push ice. It's what we do.\" If you haven't read the RS series though do yourself a favor and start in on that one. As I said, it's as good as science fiction gets.",

          "comment": "It seems to becoming fashionable these days to reuse (notice I don't use the \"P\" word) the writing of others, and pass it off as original work. (A while back, sequels were all the rage. A.C. Clarke, with some help, wrote a slew of sequels to his famous Rendezvous with Rama. It's been a while, but I seem to recall they had titles like Rama Redux, Rama Run, and Rama at Rest. I think.) Take, for instance, the recent award-winner Old Man's War by John Scalzi. Nothing but recycled Heinlein there, and not a very good job of it, either. Or, look at the present volume up for consideration, Pushing Ice. Here we have yet another Rama incarnation, neither more nor less. Perhaps such blatant, er, borrowing would be acceptable if the story weren't so awfully boring. Reynolds has little flair for characterization or pacing, and, perhaps most damning for a writer of this genre, limited imagination. I find it hard to believe that, fifty years from now, people will be using our current-day slang. Let's hope that, come 2057, \"Don't go there\" will be remembered as a quaint phrase whose usage died out sometime in the 2010's. (Then again, back in 1990, if you told me that wearing a baseball hat backwards would still be considered trendy in 2006, I'd have laughed.) Reynolds \"describes\" his characters by telling us what TV shows they watch and what slogans are on their t-shirts. In fact, he does an awful lot of telling, and not enough showing. Well-written dialogue conveys the emotional tone. With Reynolds, technology and people each get plenty of infodumps, so that the book reads more like a user's manual than a novel. And of course, the lack of imagination is the real killer. I'd be willing to read another telling of Clarke's classic, if it was interesting. After 250 pages, Pushing Ice was just not worth the effort. More like Pulling Teeth, in my opinion.",

With a Ph.D. in astronomy and working experience in space research he brings two real strengths to writing.First, because of his education, he understands the science behind the story. His comments about relativity are dead on. His projections as to future discoveries are within the understanding we have of how things work, but progressed logically.Knowing science is one thing, knowing people and especially management people is something else. His second strength comes from his working experience. Without going too much into the story, when the suggestions (orders) from Earth came to the ship, especially their response to questions about inaccurate data, well, the pointed hair manager in Dilworth comes right out.The story, is good old fashioned space opera. There are space ships, aliens (first contact), mysteries abound. But as you read it, remember to keep the Prologue in mind, especially the last sentence.",

      "description": "Japanese POW camp Changi, Singapore: hell on earth for the soldiers contained within its barbed wire walls. Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge. A taut masterwork of World War II historical fiction by bestselling author James Clavell.",

After all, it is rather depressing and there is not that much of a plot. Clavell does very well at describing the inhuman situtation and how some - the king Rat - of the title do better than others in this kind of circumstances. The prison world dehumanizes most of them, Peter Marlowe, is one the exceptions holding on to his upper class principles as much as can be expected under these circumstance. There is a lot about the relationship of the different classes in Englands and the lack of that in the USA. There is sort of a happy ending when most of the principal characters hang on their lives until their liberated with the end of the war.At the same time this looks like the downfall of the admired King Rat of the title, who when stripped of his power, has no friend left and dows nt seem to look forward to going back to freedom after the powerful postion he had enjoyed in the camp.It is powerful book and especially the ending makes it a book hard to forget. It does not have the wide range of other Clavell novels but it makes up for this by creating the claustrophobic world that was Changi. Quite recommendable.",

In a sense, we all become rats, with one as king. Much of the book studies the manipulations between folks vying for power. There are the Americans trying to enforce prison standards. There are people living off of rank to hold a grasp of dignity. And then there is the King of the title, who finds a way to transcend above the problems, living off the black market and a network of informants.We are introduced to the character that most closely resembles Clavell in this novel too. Though he reappears in Noble House, we first catch the author as the King's sidekick, a downed soldier who has to struggle with where his loyalties are.I can not recommend the series enough.

          "comment": "I came to this on a recommendation from a friend, although in fairness to the friend, it was a recommendation of Mieville generally and not of this book specifically. As things stand, I really don't have a way to evaluate that recommendation. What I can say is that this book is infuriating in a lot of ways. Mieville is undoubtably a talented writer; his sentences are crisp and engaging, his characters are well-drawn, and he is clearly out to create a fantasy book that's about more than swords and sorcery. His weaving of folklore and modern narrative into a gritty London setting is often very effective and recalls a very similar book by Neil Gaiman (Neverwhere). One can certainly do far worse than invite comparisons to Gaiman.That said, the plotting is a mess. There is too much going on by far, and about half of it feels unnecessary. There is a police procedural woven into the story that is entirely incidental; it seems to have been included to lend realistic weight (in the real world, although rarely in novels of this sort, the police would surely care that dozens of people turn up brutally murdered by a near-omnipotent sorceror) but not for any compelling aesthetic reason. Similarly, there are at least a few scenes (one involving a pudgy friend of the main character and a subway station, one involving a rat and a boat, as well as several others) that don't seem to have any function to the overall story. They're well-written and believeable, to be sure, but they aren't anything more than that.A smaller gripe I have is that I don't really know what to make of the royalty of the underground animal world. At the risk of minor spoilers, King Rat, Loplop the bird king, and Anansi the spider king left me baffled. These are anthropormorphized animals (think of the dog owners at the beginning of 101 Dalmations for a rough approximation), and Mieville makes no attempt to indicate that they are being written allegorically. They are, literally, a human-shaped rat, bird, and spider (respectively). Why would the royalty of these animal species be human? Are they shape-changers (which seems an unlikely explanation given that Mieville indicates that they can be replaced)? I have no idea, it's never explained, and there doesn't seem to be a reason for it except that Mieville needs a character who can straddle the human and animal worlds.So what we have is a novel that is quite good in a purely formal sense but that doesn't quite hold together substantively. Perhaps a different Mieville novel would make for a better - and less frustrating - place to start.",

As we get deeper into their lives we begin to get a picture of why life is worth living and the way that it should be lived. The ending of the book is much more telling than the end of most of Clavell's books and does a fine job of summarizing the book's overall purpose. By far, this is the best book that I have ever read by Clavell.",

Even when it's not something you'd really want to smell or sense, Mieville lets you have it full on. I enjoyed Ann Rice's early works for the same reason. I knew how the curtains in a room would feel under my fingertips, and how musty they'd smell. Mieville is much in the same vein in that regard, one of the best sensory descriptive writers I've encountered yet. A gripping story, too. Read his newer work!!!",

The novel takes place entirely within a POW camp run by the Japanese in Singapore. The plot is engaging and I spent a couple of days eagerly flipping pages until the end, but I didn't get the sense that I had learned anything about Singapore the way that I felt I had learned about Japan and Hong Kong from reading Shogun and Taipan. In the book's defense, it is an excellent account of life in a POW camp and the ends to which people will go to survive in them, but I am hoping that King Rat is not a harbinger of things to come for the remaining books in the series.",

          "comment": "This is the fourth book in James Clavell's \"Asian Saga\". It is also the first book he wrote and the one that is closest to being autobiographical.King Rat really can be read as a stand alone novel. It is only about 350 pages long and doesn't involve any characters from previous novels (even though Peter Marlowe and Robin Grey appear in Noble House). It is about a Japanese prisoner of war camp called Changi in World War II.The King is an American soldier who trades camp members' valuable items to the guards for money which can then be used to buy contraband food. This is against Japanese rules and, thus, camp rules but most officers turn a blind eye to the trading. Robin Grey is the exception and he sets out to catch the King and humble him.King Rat is a very accurate depiction of Japanese prisoner of war camps in World War II and shows that the only true rule in the camp is to survive.The forward of the book mentions that the original publication had removed the women's perspectives. I am glad they added those parts back in, even though I wish they could have been a little more fleshed out. The big question at the end of the book is \"what happens when the surviving soldiers go home?\" We don't learn the answer to that question (even though we know a few things about the people left behind that the men aren't aware of) but that is the point. Changi has been the entire world for these men for so long and now that they are free, how do they go back to \"normal\"?",

It remains his best.Clavell was a prisoner of the Japanese. He was held at the infamous Changi prison on the eastern end of Singapore island as described in the novel. Like the protagonist, Peter Marlowe, Clavell came from a good family, though due to his eyesight he was in the Royal Artillery, not the Royal Air Force (a little harmless wish-fulfillment, there).I think the novel impresses so many readers due to its stark simplicity and forthrightness, particularly in describing the moral dilemmas that confront Marlowe. With the issue of survival in the balance, does morality become relative? Marlowe concludes that the only man who could answer his questions, his father, is dead-- killed on the Murmansk run. But just as Changi is rebirth for Marlowe, perhaps it is the King-- the trader with the Japanese-- who becomes Marlowe's father and answers those questions.There are many, many layers to this book. I have read it many times and have always walked away with something new. As with the Changi experience, itself, I sense that there is never complete resolution.Clavell died several years ago. I hope that he found peace.Add this work to testaments like Iris Chang's, _The Rape of Nanking_, as a remembrance of what the Japanese did to the defeated.",

King Rat stands up there with the classic Ivan Denisovich any way you read it...for the great story, or for its cynical look into men's souls. This is truly Clavell's best work, no silly Ninja antics, no inane super TaiPans or Anjin-Sans and their ridiculous MegaMistresses...just a book about real men in real hell, simply written and therefore all the more powerful.King Rat is a young, cocky American civilian who finds himself drafted into the Army during WWII, and ends up a POW at the notorious Changi camp. But the King isn't an ordinary POW, he is the finagler par excellance. The savvy corporal trades whatever he gets and makes a profit however he can. And he holds sway over the corrupt POW officers because he deals for them on the black market, exchanging wedding rings and wrist watches for food -- with the King always getting his cut. Is the King wrong to take money or food as his price? The officers have been known to double deal themselves, giving King a fake Rolex to trade -- knowing full well the guard would punish King severely, maybe kill him, if the fraud was discovered. King isn't fooled. He just cheats right back, skimming a little of the top. The men of Changi are starving, their true blue, God Save the Queen officers are stealing their food and then playing bridge with clear consciences. Clavell has a great way of illustrating what most of us already know: the loudest braying patriot/hero/saviour is usually the most cowardly and venal. There is nobility, however, in the worst of us...and Clavell paints us a picture that is unforgettable. Is King the only truly uncorrupted soul at the camp? At least he's honest about his cheating. King shares his food willingly, uses his friends callously, and does his best to save those he can -- all things being equal. King's blatant disregard for moral fakery tarnishes him more than his actions. He befriends a young, innocent English pilot, all upper class bravado and stiff upper lip. At first, King seeks to use the pilot as an interpreter, but the friendship genuinely grows. King Rat looks in great detail at what men do what they have nothing left to lose. Some survive...one may even thrive. The rest cope and get by with whatever is inside them and a little luck. I hate to get all preachy here, because this is one hell of an exciting book. It's loaded with adventure. Although there is not enough explicit torture for the previous reviewer's tastes,I don't think most people would find it tame. This is not, however, a string 'em up and lash them book. It's about survival. Read it on any level you want, but by all means, read it.",

This was a really drmactic page turner for the specific reasons that there are so many levels of plot development and happenings.The two main characters are a British air officer named Marlowe and an American named the King. This book is of course about the psyche and human nature of survival in the face of insurmountable odds. When you read through the book you will think King is not so bad and doing what it takes to survive. By the end you will see the results of his behaviors, actions, and results. The last few pages are poetic and intense. I have read a lot of novels, and this one in my opinion is up there with the classics.

Then you'd get the very Neil Gaiman-ish book that is King Rat. China Mieville's freshman effort, a trim, effective little novel is drenched in originality, but maybe a little too much style.Saul returns home after a night of partying to find that his father has been murdered. He becomes the prime suspect. But while in jail, someone comes to bust him out; a strange looking man who can crawl on walls, squeeze through tight spaces and who acts like, well, a rat.This is King Rat, Saul's uncle. And he is about to tell his nephew a very strange tale indeed. Soon enough, Saul becomes a rat man himself, hiding in sewers and living in the darkness of the London underground (much of this seems familiar; British authors seem to have a fascination with the London underground, as Neil Gaiman has proven with his amazing Neverwhere.).But of course, all isn't well in the underground kingdom. Because Saul soon learns that the kingdom's enemy, the Pied Piper, is in town. And it is only when the Piper starts going after Saul's friends that things really get ugly, and bloody.Very original, beautifully described and told, King Rat is a one-of-a-kind novel that practically reads itself. It is an Urban fantasy where violence and darkness seems to reside in every corner you look. It is an engaging read that always keeps you guessing.So it is very unfortunate that the book falls victim to the first-time author disease. The prose is often self-indulgent; too many words are used when just a few would have sufficed. And some of the supportive characters seem to blend together because they are all so similar. But that problem is quickly resolved with the main characters, who are very colorfu, memorable and original.I had a lot of fun reading King Rat. Fans of Neil Gaiman or Charles de Lint should like this one. And the rest of you should find enough originality in here to last you for a long time.",

This problem is most evident in the early pages. There, \"no\" is more than once replaced by \"110\". Mention is made of \"Okhotsk 011 the coast of Siberia\", where \"011\" in the original was presumably either \"on\" or \"off\". A character is introduced as having been \"Horn on the isle of Gotland\" instead of \"Born\". These are only a few examples of the many transcription errors one could cite. This e-dition should be heavily discounted!Doig's prose is delightfully inventive in both syntax and vocabulary. I wish I could read it on my Kindle as originally written -- enter into its flow, open my mind to its idiosyncrasies -- without having to stop and puzzle out all the typos.",

The fact that the plot parallels the true story of the Temple of The Golden Pavilion's destruction (in 1950)makes the story all the more chilling and suspenseful. Ultimately,this novel will usher the thoughtful reader into areas of self reflection concerning the nature of beauty, unattainable perfection, and the harshness of life.Lovely, because Mashima is adroit at immersing the reader into a serene and beautiful world, even if it is one seen trough the eyes of a problematic individual. Several reviewers mentioned 'repetitive\" or \"heavy\" - I think that most readers of Japanese writing will not find this so, rather The Temple Of The Golden Pavilion paints a picture of a whole life seen through the eyes of one person, so the perceptions are necessarily narrow. The story unfold through the eyes of an isolated, lonely and flawed young man, who despite his speech impediment has many privileges, and several opportunities to overcome his self doubt. This is not an uplifting book. Some of Mashima's other works are more of a joy to read; I definitely would not recommend this book as your first Japanese nor your first Mashima novel. Some suggestions: the sweet, hopeless love story with a hidden edge, Spring Snow, or the lyrical and poetic Sound Of The Waves.",

For this reason alone, his \"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\" is worth reading, even if it is not your normal taste in books.Using events in 1950, when the Golden Temple was deliberately torched, as a very basic foundation to his book, Mishima writes of Mizoguchi, a stuttering young man who becomes obsessed with the Golden Temple and beauty as a general concept. Seeing himself in world that he feels separated from, Mizoguchi is influenced by many characters through the story.The book is intensely reflective and told in the first person, which gives this reflective and speculative element a deeper punch. The internal journey of Mizoguchi is the mainstay of the book, and this also focuses on Mishima's own concerns.This novel is very deep, and can get pretty heavy at times, though this is sometimes counter-balanced by moments of true humour and tension, though rarely.\"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\" is not everyone's cup of tea, so I would suggest giving it some thought before reading it. However, for something different and quite deep, it is a good book to provoke thought, and also introduce one to the thought of Yukio Mishima, himself a troubled and unusual man.",

          "comment": "The Temple Of The Golden Pavilion is possibly Mishima's most famous novel. Strangely, it's also one of his least distinctive. It is very heavily influenced by Dostoevsky, much more than any other book Mishima wrote. Mishima even seems to imitate Dostoevsky's style at times. Even the names of the characters, even though they're Japanese, somehow seem to echo with the names of Verhovensky, Karamazov and Raskolnikov. Maybe it's just the number of syllables. Dostoevsky is also present in the book's way of ascribing great psychological significance to minor details, stating its main themes through philosophical disputes between characters, and constructing those characters to symbolize the different sides in those disputes. The destruction of the Golden Temple in Kyoto, like the murder of the elder Karamazov, is a philosophical problem more than a crime.The book's protagonist Mizoguchi is a stutterer, and he is also tempted by evil thoughts. Such things cannot be independent in a book of this sort. The protagonist is evil because he is a stutterer. His stutter alienates him from society, and turns him to evil thoughts. His outer ugliness causes his inner ugliness, which in turn seems to increase his outer ugliness all the more. Mishima dwells on the speech impediment beyond all measure, until it becomes a symbol.In a book of this sort, every action taken by the protagonist must be symbolic of something. He is given to internal monologue. Even his ostensibly irrational acts are laboriously pored over. Thus, when an American soldier orders him to abuse a prostitute, his compliance is not merely an act of violence or cowardice. It is also a symbol, a highly stylized way of expressing his alienation and demonstrating his love of evil. And his refusal to confess to his actions is nothing less than \"experimenting with the single problem: 'Is evil possible?'\" (88)The book's antagonist Kashiwagi works along the same lines. He is also ugly and deformed, and this also must necessarily be a symbol of his inner evil. When he takes any action, it's not to achieve the ostensible end of the action, but to make a philosophical point. For instance, he does not go the geisha district because he desires physical pleasure. His hedonism is intellectualized by the author into a deliberate philosophical statement. He does certain things because he is nihilistic and cruel, but his nihilism and his cruelty are the products of a conscious intellectual decision on his part. After he commits his evil acts, he is always happy to sit down and explain his motives in great detail, like Dostoevsky's Smerdyakov.And the good guy, Tsurukawa, is likewise not just a good guy and an optimist, but a symbol. His purpose is to \"take [Mizoguchi's] feelings in his hand, turn them round and transmit them to the outside world\" (57). Like every other action taken by anyone in the book, this has a philosophical consequence, namely that \"there was no discrepancy between the very finest feeling in the world and the very worst; that their effect was the same; that no visible difference existed between murderous intent and feelings of deep compassion\" (57).Do real people ever think or act like this? I don't know. Maybe. But there's something unsatisfying about it. This way of writing can create dramatic intensity, as in the case of Dostoevsky. This novel, too, creates a feeling of impending doom which hangs over the setting from beginning to end. But it also feels glib. Actions which are supposed to be irrational suddenly become pre-meditated, carefully explained, constructed, and justified. A poorly educated, stuttering country boy has the eloquence of a learned philosopher in his inner monologues. And his stutter, his lowly origins, and his ugly appearance are also of great intellectual significance. They strengthen his philosophical arguments even as they are not entirely consistent with the very fact that he is articulating them. Is he a character in a novel, or an abstraction? Mishima's evil is very stylized.To find a refutation to this way of writing, we might look at Mishima's own later works. In The Decay Of The Angel, Mishima's last novel, there is a narcissistic character much like Mizoguchi who feels compelled to intellectualize his every action. Like Mizoguchi, he is drawn to evil, and he records his evil thoughts in painstaking detail. But in that novel, he meets a very ignominious end. His self-awareness is revealed to be a shallow kind of self-delusion. His idea of evil is unfavourably compared to the genuinely irrational actions of Kiyoaki Matsugae, the protagonist of Mishima's greatest novel Spring Snow.We might also look at Mishima's own life, which ended with a spectacularly irrational act known as the Mishima Incident. Strangely enough, Mishima did absolutely nothing to explain or justify this act. His last novel, which he completed on the day of the Incident, reveals nothing about it. Mishima, unlike Kashiwagi, was not inclined to exhibitionistically describe his own motives. Doesn't that mean that the character of Kashiwagi is somehow inadequate for his intended purpose? Is it his extremely stylized, self-aware philosophizing that makes him inadequate?But if that's the case, then this book begins to look weak. It is so stylized that, if one removes the intellectual arguments, there really isn't much left. In fact, it really is kind of weak. Its saving grace is in the few truly irrational moments. The best of these occurs at the end of the second chapter, when Mizoguchi and Tsurukawa observe a parting ceremony between a military officer and a woman. Mishima was very good at coming up with such striking, sensuous images. The scene is extremely short, presented without any justification whatsoever. Mizoguchi is so transfixed by the sight that he forgoes his usual commentary about rejecting the world and so forth. The description is beautifully concise. Would that the whole book were like that.",

The book combined a good plot with serious existential thought. If anything, it must be a commentary on the inner struggles of Mishima. Regardless, his desires and frustrations can be readily applied to everyday life. The long passages on the meaning of beauty the evanescense of human life were spectacular. However, I can only speculate how a school board might view this book in light of the events at Columbine. As grisly as it may be, it might give us insight into the thinking of the partcipants.",

Yukio Mishima's beautiful narrative paralyzed me the way the Golden Temple paralyzed Mizoguchi, the protagonist. A talented writer-philosopher, Mishima skillfully toyed with various aspects of beauty, fear, and faith, ultimately meltings them into one great encompassing theme that destroys the mystery behind what many of us lack: confidence. I strongly recommend this book to the artistically minded--especially those who has not found the courage to express themselves.",

The rich Venetian Republic is a bastion of independence and tolerance. Perhaps for that reason, it is also corrupt, and rotten with intrigue. But for the young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, vagabond and thief, Venice is simply-home. They have no idea that they stand at the center of the city's coming struggle for its very life. They know nothing of the powerful forces moving in the background. They have barely heard of Chernobog, demonlord of the North, who is shifting his pawns to attack Venice in order to cut into the underbelly of the Holy Roman Empire. All Marco and Benito know is that they're hungry and in dangerous company: Katerina the smuggler, Caesare the sell-sword, Montagnard assassins, church inquisitors, militant Knights of the Holy Trinity, Dottore Marina the Strega mage . . . and Maria. Maria might be an honest canaler, but she had the hottest temper a boy could find. Yet among the dark waters of the canals lurk far worse dangers than a hot-tempered girl. Chernobog has set a monster loose to wreak havoc on the city. Magic, murder and evil are all at work to pull Venice down. Fanatical monks seek to root out true witchcraft with fire and sword. Steel-clad Teutonic knights, wealth traders, church dignitaries and great Princes fight and plot for control of the jewel of the Mediterranean. And somehow all of these, from thieves to mages to princes, must gather around Marco and his brother Benito, under the shadow of the great winged lion of Venice.

I don't usually recommend books to people, but I definitely recommend this one!The interplay of well-developed characters, the suspense, and the action make this book one you won't be able to put down. There were twists and turns that I couldn't anticipate, and the murky political world of 16th century Venice is the perfect backdrop for the story.If this is a stand alone book with no sequel then the only down side is wondering what happens with such well-developed characters as Benito, Maria, Lopez, Eric, the Prince, Francesca, Dell'Este, the Emperor, the Duke, and Chernobog.",

This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her.",

Everyone has their own opinion and their own gods, of every shape and size - all fighting for faith, followers, and a place at the top. So when the great god Om accidentally manifests himself as a lowly tortoise, stripped of all divine power, it's clear he's become less important than he realised. In such instances, you need an acolyte, and fast. Enter Brutha, the Chosen One - or at least the only One available. He wants peace, justice and love - but that's hard to achieve in a world where religion means power, and corruption reigns supreme . . .

On the surface, it is a hilarious and touching story of a once-mighty god and his last remaining believer, but Pratchett's astounding wisdom and understanding of human nature take it much deeper, through labyrinths literal, metaphorical, and moral. At the center are the questioning of a religion where belief centers on the church, rather than the god, and the way a sole believer can shift his god's way of thinking and take a religion with it.At the same time, Pratchett employs his usual side-splitting humor and vile puns to show us the silly side of serious philosophy, atheism in a world with thousands of gods, and exactly why tortoises hate eagles. And that even an orang-utan Librarian from across the sea can help if books are burning.If I was asked &quot;Which is the best Discworld novel?&quot; I'd say, with the possible exception of Hogfather, this one.Finally, a tortoise has learned how to fly.",

          "comment": "Terry Pratchett is a phenomenal writer! I'll tell you that any of his books, especially the Disc World series are well worth picking up! In my youth I loved the Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien (and yes, I'm talking pre-movie adolescence, thank you). I read any fantasy/adventure novels I could get my hands on. Eventually I ran out of books worth reading.... In my late teens I even resorted to Harry Potter, which I thought was amusing (but with a very low reading level) until I stumbled upon Terry Pratchett. Oh what a day! It was as if I had been waiting for his writing since the first time I picked up a book! The worlds he has created within the Disc world series are so interesting and entertaining. On each page he has spelled out endless wit, comedy, and enchantment. The characters hook you from the start and in each book you learn more about them and how they intertwine with one another. The imagery Pratchett depicts with his stories is absolutely amazing! And one of the things that I think is the best about this series is you don't necessarily have to read them in a particular order. There are a few here or there within the series that do fit better together read in a certain order but besides those you can just go with the next one that strikes your fancy. Every time I finish one I CANNOT wait for the next! Soon I'll be done with the series and this is sad... But reading them all was well worth it! See for yourself!",

          "comment": "Small Gods was perhaps the best book Terry Pratchett has ever written. It was a bit more serious than most of his other books, which was partly why I liked it. The book was refreshing to read, simply because I had never read anything with so much to say that managed to say is so clearly, while still maintaining a light-hearted attitude.One thing I enjoyed about Small Gods was that it kept my attention the whole way through. The plot was fantastic with many interesting little twists and turns that made me want to keep reading. It was basically about a god who gets reincarnated as a turtle. He figures out that his believers beleive in his church because they are afraid of it, but nothim. It was very well-written and told the story flawlessly. Quite aside from that, it had me falling out of my chair from laughing on several occasions. Needless to say, I enjoyed it.The book also had great characters. It was easy to relate to them because they acted like regular people, but without becoming stereotype nonentities who just lead their boring lives. There were all different types of personalities with all their different opinions and emotions, but the narration stayed neutral the whole time. One thing that's important in any story is a good villain and this one had it. His name is Vorbis and he's the head of what I assume is the Discworld parallel of the Inquisition. I hated him throughout the whole book. He was a cynic and a sadist, but Pratchett does us the enormous service of never dehumanizing him the whole time. He had motives for what he did, even though they were twisted, and at the end we pity him more than hate him.It wasn't just fluff. It's very easy to classify all books with humor in them as fluff, but you can't do that with this one. It had an idea behind it throughout the whole book and even somewhat of a moral. This was that people should never ever be treated as things. Pratchett applies this to every character and not just the villain. One thing that I appreciated was the fact that Pratchett maintained a clear head throughout the whole thing. He tried to be inoffensive, but not too hard. There is a fine line between inoffensive and politically correct, and Pratchett didn't cross it. Overall, I thought it was because it made me think.In conclusion, I give Small Gods two thumbs up and five stars because it deserved it. I felt better for reading it and highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't.",

          "comment": "\"Small Gods\" is a book set in the Discworld universe. It is a stand-alone book and not part of any other series (i.e. the City Watch, Death, Wyrd Sisters). It's also a very good book, though it's nowhere near my favourite. The back cover calls it a great comedy, but I didn't find it all that funny. It was good, makes very insightful comments on religion and how it is set up. There are some great moments in the book as well. Most of these consist of indirect comments on our world that just pop up and hit you in the face with their accuracy. But again, it's not that funny.It is set in the land of Omnia, a heavily religious land, or at least it seems to the outside. They are very intolerant of other religions, going so far as to torture heretics for their beliefs. In reality, though, there is no real belief there. It has become a power structure instead of a true religion. Om, the god that they worship, has come to visit. Unfortunately, while he intended to come down as something noble (like a swan), he appeared as a tortoise. To make things worse, he traveled the Disc for three years without realizing he was Om. This happened because nobody truly believes in him any more, and gods derive their power from belief.There is one person who does believe in him very deeply, though, and that's Brutha. Because of this, Om has to use him to try and get his followers back. Brutha is a very simple man; he can't read and write, and he enjoys puttering around in the temple garden. He's a very unlikely choice for a chosen one. Unfortunately, he's the only choice Om has. One thing Brutha does have is a fantastic memory. He can remember everything he sees, even if he doesn't know what it means. This ability very often comes in handy, whether it has to do with the library or getting out of a maze. Om finds that a simple man isn't always the most easily controlled, though.The story is a very interesting comment on religious practices. It covers everything from organized religion to the creationism/evolution debate. The people of Omnia don't believe that the world is flat, on the backs of four elephants that are standing on a Great Turtle. No religion is singled out for ridicule, though, as most of the comments are made about religious structure in general. The belief that a god's power is based on how many people believe in him is very interesting. Neil Gaiman uses the same idea in his American Gods book.The characters are all well done. Brutha is an unlikely prophet, but as events happen to him and he grows into the role (no matter how reluctantly), you believe the transition. Vorbis, the exquisitor (as opposed to the inquisitor), is suitably sadistic. He's the one main character that you could say is slightly two dimensional because you don't know why he is what he is. He's not as devout as he seems, and he does enjoy his work, but that's pretty much all we know.Om is a great character, though. He's suitably sarcastic. He uses Brutha for his own ends. He tries to keep Brutha in the dark about how the belief system works, and why he has appeared to Brutha. He's arrogant (shown especially when he visits the other gods). He also has many of the best lines.The main problem with this book, though, is that the comedy just doesn't seem to be there. Sure, after reading the annotations, some of the bits seem funnier. Maybe I just wasn't getting the jokes as much. Some of the exchanges between Brutha and Om are priceless. The philosophers of Ephebe make their return from Pyramids, and they are hilarious. I always enjoy them. But there's not enough of it. Perhaps this one just went over my head. One of the things that is really missing is the funny footnotes. In the previous books I've read, there are footnotes on almost every third or fourth page. They were great! However, this one only has a few of them. I would call this book more \"amusing\" then \"funny.\"Still, the book is well worth reading, and I would suggest you pick it up for the philosophical insights and the writing. There are some funny moments as well, just not as many. And if you already like Pratchett, this is certainly a good one to continue with.",

The only other author able to do this for me is PJ O'Rourke. If you read it on public transport, people will look at you and think you're kinda strange, unless they too know who Pratchett is, in which case they will envy you reading and try to catch furtive glimpses of the text over your shoulder.This is one of my favourite books of all time -- read it and love it too.

Taking place far away from the more familiar setting of Ankh-Morpork, the story centers on the struggle for religious freedom, and the difference between truth and perception.Through absolutely no fault of his own, Brutha, a novice in the church of Omnia, has the misfortune of meeting his God as a voice inside his own head. Whereas the church is one of persecution, power grabbing and torture, Brutha is a peace-loving individual, slow in thought and imagination. He is ill prepared for meeting a deity. Om, his God, isn't having a very good day either.Practchett utilizes his unique sense of humor and the setting of Discworld, to satire modern culture and popular thought. In \"Small Gods\", the issues tackled are religion, fanaticism and the drive for power. Whereas all of the Discworld books are funny, \"Small Gods\" is both funny and extremely thought provoking, with perhaps the hint of a message.The book isn't quite as silly as, for instance, \"Reaper Man\", but there is plenty of the traditional silliness throughout. No need to lose one's sense of humor when making a point. Pratchett manages with style. (The guide to Discworld at the back is pretty fun, as well.)",

          "comment": "A few weeks ago I finished my first Discworld novel, 'Mort', which was a very light and funny book. Therefore, I assumed all Discworld novels would be like this.. I guess I was wrong. Small Gods is funny (at least in the beginning) - but far, far from being a light book, which is not necessarily a bad thing.Small Gods tells about Brutha, a not so smart lad who one day hears the voice of his great god Om calling him. But contrary to what he expected, the great god Om wasn't really such a great god - in fact, he was quite small.. like a turtle. And he didn't have any powers at all. And apparently, not many believers either. The book tells about the god Om and Brutha's adventures, trying to survive in Omnia (which is a very religious in a fanatic way...) - and maybe even restore the god to his full power.The book really started light, but turned into a very heavy and philosophical novel about the nature of religions and gods - and of people and belief. Really, I think it would've fit quite well into a philosophy class. Typically to Terry Pratchett, the book is very very witty - I don't think the man knows how to write in an 'Unwitty' way. I don't think I laughed at all during the second half of the book, but I still couldn't stop reading it - and definitely enjoyed the read. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Discworld, and enjoys reading books which make you think afterwards. However, don't get it if you want a book which will just make you laugh.",

          "comment": "Pratchett writes to a formula, and whatever else can be said about it, it's obviously a very successful one. He takes a basic unifying theme for a book, throws in a liberal mixture of other ideas and literary devices, stuffs them all into the sausage-machine, round goes the handle and out comes the usual product. He does it very skilfully. There is plenty of variety in the situations, he knows how to catch the reader's attention at the start, he can introduce new characters into the narrative at any point in a very natural way, and he is particularly adept at finding a clever and convincing ending. He writes largely for a public who know his previous work and who know what to expect, and he obviously knows how to keep them pleased and how not to upset them with surprises of an unfamiliar kind. There's nothing wrong with any of this. Much the same could be said about Agatha Christie, or about Chandler or about Wodehouse. What surprises me in some of the press comment that I've seen is what Pratchett's formula seems to amount to in the minds of some readers. The New York Times, for instance, credits him with `a multifarious genius for strong parody', which I can go along with. On the other had it also finds that his `wit is metaphysical'; and The Times of London itself manages to compare him to Swift and detect that he can `hold up a distorting mirror to our own [world]'. This kind of thing seems to me to go miles over the top.When Swift attacked religious and secular orthodoxies he was playing for much higher stakes and taking far bigger risks. When Swift said (I quote from memory) `There are those who would die for no-Popery and know not if it be Man or Horse' the wit is as caustic as sulphuric acid. Can anyone seriously put Pratchett in the same bracket? Pratchett can turn out some nice lines certainly, like the soldier's statement that `For centuries we died for lies. Now we've got a truth to die for.' All the same, unquestioning religious belief is easy meat these days for the sceptics and satirists, to say nothing of the steady bombardment from the heavyweight philosophers. Pratchett's trick is to keep the tone light and to take so many incidental swipes at so many incidental targets that the reader never feels `got at'. To have a philosopher called Aristocrates who wrote a volume of `Platitudes' is nice lightweight satire, and very typical of the general style. To say `People allowed to be by themselves overmuch might indulge in solitary cogitation. It was well known that this stunted your growth. For one thing it could lead to your feet being chopped off.' is good average nudge-nudge humour. `Where there is punishment there is always a crime' is definitely a bon mot but not exceptional, and `It was a beard you could camp out in' suggests imitation of Chandler to me. There are any number of whimsical digressions, and some very run-of-the-mill naughty little verbal innuendoes like `I will write you more balls than you can imagine...'. It's all a matter of what we're prepared to laugh at, and as far as I'm concerned We Are Just About Amused but not much more.Pratchett's great strength seems to be that he can keep it all going in book after book after book. I have now read three of them, and I sense that as far as I'm concerned that's It. If three is sufficient of a selection, then I would guess that in the others he can keep his standard relatively high without cheapening himself, and that recurrent characters like Death who always talks in CAPITALS and who says `SQUEAK' to rats will be welcomed by his faithful each time. In general faith is not my own strong point, and I haven't succumbed to the Pratchett faith either. Those who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like. They are clearly numerous, and they are not likely to be disappointed by Small Gods. I like it up to a point myself.What does this reaction prove? I suppose it only proves that the formula doesn't greatly work for everyone, and we would all have known that in the first place.",

          "comment": "It's easy to see why a lot of praise has been heaped on the novels of Terry Pratchett and this novel in particular. First of all, it's very humorous. Perhaps not as humorous as he thinks it is, and perhaps not always humorous when he's trying to be, but humorous nevertheless, and occasionally humorous in the laugh-out-loud, belly-guffaw way.More importantly, it tosses around a lot of post-modern, leftist, philosophical sound-bites that, simple-minded as they are, often pass for intelligence or insight in our benumbed society. This is what undoubtedly makes it so attractive: not only is it clever, but it also has a Lot of Important Things to Say, like, we all have to be nice to each other, man, and war is unhealthy for children and other living things, man, and religion can be used for bad purposes, man. It is not generalizing or over-simplifying to say this; it is literally, as we shall see, what it has to say.It's probably not necessary to summarize the loony plot as the plot isn't really the focus of the novel, but here goes anyway. The country of Omnia, which is dominated by cruel religious fanatics, is destined to be reshaped by a new prophet. He is the simple-minded acolyte, Brutha. Brutha is visited by the primary god of the nation, Om, who is at the moment manifested in his earthly (sorry, Discworldly) guise as a weak and slow-moving tortoise, because nobody really believes in him anymore except for Brutha. The more people who believe in a particular god, you see, the stronger and more powerful the god.Briefly, Brutha and Om take part unwittingly in a plot by the evil mastermind Omnian leader Vorbis to conquer the neighboring land of Ephebe, which is run by a democratically elected tyrant, and which is loaded with philosophers who wander around arguing vehemently with one another. Vorbis believes he must instill the will of Om to the Ephebian people, unaware that Om at that moment is traveling with him in the body of a lowly tortoise. Ironic, eh? Well, it goes on from there; needless to say, it provides Mr. Pratchett a grand forum in which to comment on the nature of gods and men, the uselessness or usefulness of philosophy, the nature of good and evil, the random arbitrary nature of fate, the . . . aw, you get the idea.As mentioned, the novel can often be quite funny, particularly the conversations between the caustic Om and his dimwitted protector, Brutha, the only person who can hear him. Om is stunned to learn all of the things that have been written about him and all the things he is alleged to have said; all he really cares about is getting a nice bite of lettuce and to avoid the eagle overhead that wants to make a meal out of him. Brutha, the one true believer in Omnia, is equally stunned to learn that Om doesn't seem to know or care about the things on which Brutha has based his entire belief-system. This is very funny stuff.Less successful are the various one-liners scattered throughout the novel which strike one as being \"cute,\" rather than clever. \"Brutha obeyed immediately. Brutha did not know the meaning of the word disobedience. It was only one of a large number of words he didn't know the meaning of.\" Cute. And some of the humor is cringe-worthy. The Ephebean god of wind, for example, is named, \"Flatulus.\" The messenger god is, \"Fedechs.\" Ho, ho, ho.Having said that, though, the book is at least entertaining, and if you go into it expecting nothing more, you will be pleased. But if you are expecting some sort of deep thought or meaningful insight you're going to be disappointed. Most readers will have worked out the, \"god-or-man-who-came-first\" conundrum in their teens or at the very latest in their freshman, Philosophy 101 class. And after the plot chronicles the long, starving journey in the desert, the hallucinatory meeting with the saint, the confrontation with the lion, the betrayal by Vorbis, and the reestablishment of Om as a great god and with Brutha as his prophet, we are left with nothing more than this feeble-minded observation: \"I think . . . you should do things because they're right. Not because gods say so.\" A couple of pages later somebody says, \"But there's no reason to fight!\" And somebody answers, \"Yes, there is. Honor and revenge and duty and things like that.\" Things like that. Obviously, the author has a rather disparaging view of warfare--under any circumstances--an illogical premise commonly shared by our modern-day, lock-step intelligentsia.Look, if you think Vonnegut is some kind of brilliant philosopher and Tom Robbins is the epitome of the clever wordsmith, you'll probably drool over this thing. But if you've long ago abandoned these seers to the dustbin of cheap thought, prepare with Small Gods to be mildly amused, nothing more.",

          "comment": "-- sooner or later.Pratchett has done the unthinkable - kept a series (and a humor series at that) alive and fresh well into its second dozen. This book started that second dozen.It's about Brutha, a minor novitiate even among novitiates who are all minor. He's doing what he does best, hoeing the beans, when his god arises before him in physical manifestation:A turtle. Slow. Partial to lettuce. Not fond of being turned over or dropped. Not much for conversation when it gets cold out. And, as near as Om can tell, the god of Brutha only. No one else seems to be paying much attention when the god calls down plagues, or at least some really nasty rashes.In Prathcett's hands, this small start yields a very worthy bit of amusement. No, there's really no point to what Pratchett writes (well, that's what he wants you to think). Brutha crosses his world, overturns empires as easily as he overturns weeds in the bean-patch, and dies happy. Everyone dies, and Brutha has seen lots of the other ways - this really is a happy ending.For all of its shallow jests, this book has rewards for the serious reader. Brutha wins in the end by be slow, thick, and mind-bogglingly even-handed. Om finally comes out of his shell and really makes his entry, even among the more exclusive clubs of the gods. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end, no matter what you thought they deserved. By the way: observe Om, the lowly turtle, and the place of the turtle in Discworld cosmology.Pratchett fans: watch Vorbis. Yes, the character dies, but that doesn't mean much in Discworld. He may reincarnate as Vetinari, or maybe as Vetinari's evil identical twin. Death is there, all caps, but really quite a congenial chap - says \"Thank you\" when you pass him the bottle, sort of thing. The librarian is there, working hard in librarian heroics. Lu Tze is there, makin sure that history turns out the way it's supposed to, not that he has a lot to work with.Every series has its ups and downs. This is a serious up for Discworld.

          "comment": "When Brother Brutha of the Omnian Church starts talking to a tortoise, he merely assumes that he has gone mad. However, when the tortoise turns out to be the great god Om who is having a Bad Day, Brutha finds that his faith is about to be put to the test...Up to (and including) Witches Abroad, Terry Pratchett was an author who wrote books that broadly fell in two categories: books that spoofed or were a satire of modern society in some way, often through broad comedy, and other books that were a bit more serious and had a point to them, though still amusing. The two sides had come very close to coexisting in Pyramids, but arguably just managed to avoid fusing into one impressive whole.Small Gods is where Pratchett got it right. The entire book, from its first page to its last, is a lengthy, sustained and inordinately clever examination of religion, fundamentalism and blind faith and their conflict with reason, argument and science. And you barely notice, because the story itself is extremely taut, well-told and brilliantly characterised with Pratchett's occasional bursts of silliness kept to a minimum in favour of flashes of wry and at times angry humour. Small Gods is a book that Richard Dawkins would kill to have written, and done so in such a manner that even the most God-bothering evangelical would have still been riveted to it.Small Gods has the veneer of being just a traditional Pratchett book: there's some jokes about men in togas arguing pointlessly about philosophy (in a world where it is difficult to have a conversation about, \"Are the gods real?\" when a lightning bolt will come flying through the window five seconds later with a label attached saying, \"YES,\"), Death has a couple of cameo appearances and there is a running joke about tortoises being nice to eat. But you can tell the subject matter really got Pratchett riled up. His hatred of blind faith and the idea that killing people is okay because some book says so - and, let's face it, that book was written by a old guy who might have been bitten by a donkey that morning and was a really foul mood when he started on the bit about doing unto others with fire and brimstone and was probably not, when you get down to it, an actual deity - really comes through in this novel, but in measured tones.Character-wise, Small Gods may be Pratchett's strongest book. Most of the cast does not reoccur in the series (Death and a very brief trans-temporal appearance by a certain simian book-collector aside), but Pratchett still has time to paint them in impressive detail. Vorbis may be one of the scariest 'villains' (if that's even a right description) in the whole series. Brutha is certainly one of its most interesting protagonists. Om's pragmatic, tortoise-meets-deity outlook on life is amusing. Even minor characters like Didactylos and would-be rebel leader Simony are well-rounded and given good rationales for what they do.Almost as importantly, the ending does not suck. Pratchett has a patchy record with endings, with his books sometimes ending okay and others being a bit of a let-down after a strong start and middle section. Small Gods, however, has a fantastic ending, starting with possibly the biggest belly-laugh out of all thirty-odd books in the series (hint: it involves something being airborne which shouldn't be) and proceeding from there.Intelligent but never preachy, philosophical but never boring, Small Gods (*****) is Terry Pratchett's masterpiece (okay, his strongest masterpiece). It is the strongest Discworld novel and almost certainly the best thing he has ever written.",

One of my favorite characters is the blind prophet Didactylos, who carries a &quot;lantern that doesn't shine for a man that doesn't see&quot; because it &quot;works perfectly, and of course, is very philosophical&quot;. In my opinion, this not the &quot;usual&quot; fantasy novel in any way.

The main character doesn't show up anywhere else in the series, but a secondary character, Lu-Tze, does. Also, the main thrust of the plot is fairly important in a few later books. You could probably pick this book up without having read any other Pratchett. But, I wouldn't recommend skipping it (regardless of my mere 3 star rating).Normally, I love anything by Pratchett. But, this book's a poser. It's VERY well written in good Pratchett style. It has a good plot, good theme, and a few nice twists and turns. My problem with the book is that it's not \"nice.\" In fact, it's depressing. The prevalence of rot and evil that the main character has to fight makes my stomache churn. I read Pratchett to lighten my life. This book doesn't do that. Technically, it's a VERY good book. I just don't like the subject material. Splitting the difference, I can only give it a rating of 3 stars out of 5.",

      "description": "THESE 24 Iroquois legends and stories have been told in the homes of the Iroquois for many centuries; long before the white man arrived on the North American continent. The perusal and study of these stories will, it is believed, give as much pleasure to the reader, as they have given the compiler. Of special interest is the “Legend of Hiawatha” made famous fifty years earlier by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Some of the stories and lengends in this volume are: The Birth of the Arbutus A Legend Of The River Legends Of The Corn The First Winter The Great Mosquito The Story Of Oniata The Legends of Hiawatha, and many, many more. The American Indians, like so many cultures, built neither monuments nor wrote books. However, they did make picture writings, known in later years as “wampum.” Mostly, these were mere symbols, recording mainly feats of arms. However, the Iroquois used wampum as a record of a person’s credentials or a certificate of authority. It was also used for official purposes and religious ceremonies, and it was used as a way to bind peace between tribes. Among the Iroquois, every chief and every clan mother has a certain string of wampum that serves as their certificate of office. When they pass on or are removed from their station, the string will then pass on to the new leader. Runners carrying messages during colonial times would present the wampum showing that they had the authority to carry the message. Wampum is still used to this day by the Iroquois in the ceremony of raising up a new chief and in the Iroquois Thanksgiving ceremonies. If the American forefathers had taken more interest in the peoples they found on the Western Continent, spending less of their energies in devising plans for cheating the Indians out of their furs and lands—a policy their descendants have closely followed and admirably succeeded in—our libraries might contain volumes of fairy tales that would delight the youth of many generations. =========== KEYWORDS/TAGS: Legends of the Iroquois, Aliquipiso, American Indian, american indian ancestry, American Indian books, American Indian childrens books, american indian east coast, american indian Iroquois, american Indian legends, american indian songs, american indian stories, american indian tales, american indian traditions, american indian tribes, american indian values, american indian warriors, american indian words, animals, Arbutus, arrows, Ash Tree, assemble, Authority, beads, bear, beautiful, beaver, bedtime stories, birds, Birth, brave, Buzzard's Covering, canoe, chief, children, childrens books, childrens stories, Confederation, corn, Cornplanter, council, council fire, dead, death, death song, eagle, earth spirits, evil, fables, fairy tales, First Winter, Flying Head, folklore, Folk-Lore, forest, fox, Gift, Great, Great Mosquito, happiness, Happy, Healing Waters, heart, Hiawatha, horse, Hunter, Hunting Grounds, Indians, Iroquois, Kanistagia, lakes, Legend of the River, legends, Legends of the Corn, lodge, lover, maiden, Manito, medicine, men, Message Bearers, Mirror in the Water, Mohawk, mountains, myths, Native American, Nekumonta, Oneida, Oniata, Onondagas, Origin, Orontadeka, panther, papoose, peace, Peacemaker, pipe, raccoon, river, sachem, sacred, Sacred Stone, Sacrifice, Seneca, Shanewis, Spirit, stories, streams, summer, sun, Tiogaughwa, trail, trees, Turtle Clan, Unwelcome Visitor, village, Violet, wampum, warriors, waters, white men, Why Animals do not Talk, wigwam, wild, wisdom, Wise Sachem, wolf, woods, young people",

Some of the character names clearly denote important historical encounters and events. When I went exploring the idea of the `stone' giants, I found information about American giants and armor skin that repelled stone tipped weapons. There's far more behind that story than what is available to the casual observer.The assortment of symbols from Indian story telling found in this book seems to draw from various Eastern and Mid-western pictures/pictoglyphs and forms a unit on telling a story as a `visual learner`. I bought my copy from a market-place text book vender, and the student notes in the margin were puzzling around the story of two brothers who go out to hunt, and wind up inside the earth confronting a gigantic ferocious beast (a giant mouse.)Who hasn't heard:\"the world will build a path to your door, if you build a better mouse trap.\"And to the early American, other metaphorically gigantic creatures (because they did and do defy eradication) also included flying insects. If you've never watched the family film, `Mouse Hunt', then you've deprived yourself the laughter of being confronted with the absurdity and the irony of just how un-assailable is the mighty midget tyrannosaurus mouse.

After that, it seems like she forgets why she was originally writing the story and goes off talking about something completely unrelated. This would have made sense if the storylines had been brought together at some point, but they were not.No mention of the characters or events from the first half of the book until the final 3 or 4 pages; and then it seems almost as an afterthought, as if trying to tie up loose ends. The end result left me with too many unanswered questions, and really no desire to see them answered by this writer.If you like artsy books that lead to nowhere, then this is for you.

          "comment": "A book called \"Hard Times\" doesn't sound like the type of book you'd pick up for some light, cheerful reading, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - or its title either. \"Hard Times\" certainly deals with a difficult subject, but thanks to the genius of Dickens, it never becomes unbearably depressing.At the centre of the novel are the upheavals of the mid-1800s that changed the world forever: the rise of the Industrial Revolution, mass manufacturing and capitalism, and the rural-to-urban flow that led to compulsory schooling and shocking living conditions for vast amounts of the English population. The Enlightenment was gaining in popularity, as was the bourgeois class, which was gradually outing the old aristocracies. It was a time of drastic social and economic change, and inevitably many less-fortunate people fell down the cracks in the new system. With all this as his background, Dickens creates various characters of differing classes and the impact such social changes had in their lives. Exploring the phenomena on individual, familial and social levels, Dickens reveals some of the pain and misery that plagued his time-period, and is still very much relevant to our present day condition.What is vitally important to understand is that reading \"Hard Times\" is reading history - in more ways than one. As a philanthropist who investigated the factory conditions of the working class, Dickens not only vividly describes the situation as he saw it with his own two eyes, but threw light on the cruelty that was at work to the general public (before there was investigative journalists, there were novelists). It was partly because of the publicity that Dickens raised in regards to factories and workhouses that philanthropists came to the aid of the poor and that laws were passed in order to secure better conditions for the lower classes. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.Thrown into the mix of this great social and political satire are a range of vivid (though often one-dimensional characters) of all classes and situations who all dwell in the industrial town of Coketown, described as \"a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it...a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.\" Out of this miserable place comes Sir Thomas Gradgrind, a man uninterested in anything but facts - at school, at home and in life in general. His children Louisa and Thomas are the products of a strictly factually-based education; as a result she is clinically depressed (as we would describe it in modern terms) and her brother turns to cards and drinking in order to alleviate his boredom with the world. Among the lower-class is Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking older man who is in love with fellow worker Rachael, but because of his class is unable to divorce his drunken wife. Providing the lighter side of this dreary existence is the circus, which brings colour and enjoyment into the lives of the Coketown residents simply for its own sake, personified by Sissy Jupes, the daughter of a clown who brings a sense of fancy and spiritual understanding into the lives around her that mere facts don't even begin to provide.All of these lives, plus many more eventually collide in typical Dickens melodrama, with the clear message that imagination (or \"fancy\") and the need for simple pleasures in life are essential for the good of humanity. Whether it is in the strict classroom, the dismal workhouses or the familial unit, the human spirit will be crushed without some measure of light, laughter and enjoyment. As an extra bonus, \"Hard Times\" is one of Dickens's shortest novels; if you are a steady reader it shouldn't take you more than a week to complete!Some critique \"Hard Times\" as being too transparent in some of its themes and messages, and though this is probably true (with his characters representing different points of view, rather than being three-dimensional figures), this is precisely the point of the novel. Unlike \"David Copperfield\" or \"Great Expectations\", this is not a story that revolves around one particular character and their development, but rather an assemble piece that has the `hard times' as its main focus. Therefore, characters do not need to be anything but a representative of worldview; Mr Gradgrind as the strict rationalist, Bounderby as the hypocritical bourgeois member, Blackpool as the angelic poor man, Mrs Sparsit as a member of the fading aristocracy and Slackbridge as an ignorant trades-union agitator (proving that although Dickens had sympathy for the poor, he still believed that giving them *too* much power was a dangerous thing).These were hard times indeed, but this novel attempts to show that there is hope for humanity to see such times through to the other side.",

          "comment": "To be quite honest, I didn't find this book overly entertaining. However, though you may call me old-fashioned, I still believe there is educational value to reading. And the book is educational. For openers, it provides us a picture of the world in which Dickens lived. It isn't a very attractive picture, but it is probably an accurate one. The city of Coketown was dirty; its inhabitants breathed polluted air; they struggled to make ends meet. There were a few exceptions among the upper echelon, like Bounderby who owned a country home to which he could retreat. But for the most part, the citizens of Coketown were trapped in a day-to-day mundane existence that didn't offer many bright spots. There's no way I would want to trade places.The book is also revealing in other ways. We learn of the class structures of Dickens' day. We learn of the silly pretensions and the airs people of the upper class put on. Morality and integrity seem mostly limited to the lower class, particularly the circus. Dickens gives us a picture of education that is dreary, directed at the head and away from the heart. The carrying out of justice seems somewhat elusive. In the words of Stephen Blackpool, \"its all a muddle.\" This could be a summary of the times. Things do seem to be pretty messed up.Still, the book has its appeal. I think for me, the best part was the descriptions of the characters. They definitely weren't complex or sophisticated. On the contrary, they were almost too obvious in their representation of the roles they played. They remind me of facades of a building on a movie set. Bounderby is constantly bragging that he \"came from a ditch.\" His character reminds me of so many people who thrive on a sense of their own importance. Tom was a whiner--please, spare me the privileged child who is never satisfied and always looking to be bailed out. Louisa needed to get some gumption and stop doing everything according to the book. For Pete's sakes, forget your upbringing and get a life! Sissy was fun; and Rachael was admirable. Stephen Blackpool got quite a bit of ink devoted to him. Had his character had a better command of the English language we might actually have been able to understand what he was saying. Oh, well. The best characters, without a doubt, were Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer. Mrs. Sparsit gets the Oscar for best female in a comedy role; Bitzer for the character everyone loves to hate. The circus people deserve at least a mention; they definitely add some color to the novel.So, no, its not a must-read, in my opinion. But I've definitely read a lot worse. You must take fair warning, though. Nearly everyone I know has to power through at least the first half of the book. Eventually it gains some momentum, and you'll probably want to finish it. Even if you're not crazy about the book, you can still mention you've read something by Charles Dickens. Someone somewhere might actually be impressed.",

          "comment": "Always concerned with issues of class, social injustice, and employment, Dickens shows in Hard Times, written in 1854, a broader concern with the philosophies and economic movements which underlie those issues. Three parallel story lines reflect a broad cross-section of society and its thinking.Mr. Thomas Gradgrind runs a school founded upon the principles of rationalism, a belief in the importance of facts, the antithesis of romantic \"fancy\" and imagination. Basically a good man, he denies the importance of emotion--for himself, his children, and his students. Only Student #20, Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus clown, fails to conform to his notions, and in a hilarious, satiric scene at the beginning of the novel, Dickens shows the absurdity of Gradgrind's teachings.Gradgrind's friend, Mr. Bounderby, is a banker and factory owner, aged fifty, who claims to have risen from the gutter to his present lofty position through hard work. Bounderby treats the employees of his Coketown factory as machines, rather than as humans, and his eventual marriage to the teenaged Louisa Gradgrind is seen by both as a marriage of \"tangible fact,\" having nothing to do with affection.The third story line involves Stephen Blackpool, a worker in Bounderby's factory, trapped in a marriage to an alcoholic who periodically appears and extorts money from him. Stephen is in love with Rachael, an adoring factory worker, but his appeal to Bounderby for help in ending his marriage is met with cold, rational pronouncements. Shortly after, Bounderby fires Stephen \"for a novelty,\" forcing him to seek employment elsewhere.As the story lines overlap and intersect, often with consummate irony, Dickens keeps a light enough hand to prevent the story from becoming a polemic, though his criticism of hypocrisy, corruption, and \"progress\" at the expense of humanity is clear. His humor, often dark, keeps the plot moving, and several of his characters, which are often caricatures, do grow and change. Characteristically, Dickens uses names symbolically-Gradgrind grinds the emotions from his graduates, hires Mr. M'Choakumchild as a teacher, and lives at Stone Lodge. Mr. Bounderby proves to be a bounder. Some of the circus performers, like Sissy, live at Pegasus Arms.The dramatic conclusion, which involves the pursuit of an innocent character widely believed to have committed a robbery, draws all the themes together, showing the parallels, contrasts, and ironies which connect these characters, regardless of their social level. Less epic in plot than some of Dickens's other novels, Hard Times provides an intimate look at a changing economy and an important commentary on the philosophies of the times. N Mary Whipple",

          "comment": "Readers should always remember that while reading. Instead of the usual monthly periodical installments with room to spare, \"Hard Times\" was done in weekly installments with a very limited space allotment, for the newspaper \"Household Words.\" Dickens found the combined pressure of time and space nearly intolerable, given the breadth and depth of his vision for needed social reform. One can only imagine how much better, fuller, and more satisfying this book would have been -- in plot, character-development, dramatic impact -- if Dickens had written it as 900 pages over two years, rather than 300 pages in five months.",

          "comment": "While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed.I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a \"Uriah Heep\" or \"Fagin.\" Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed.Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son.",

          "comment": "In this novel set in industrial revolution era Great Britain, Dickens is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Unlike some of his other social commentary, where he wraps his point in a gripping, twisting, and entertaining plot, Dickens goes right for the jugular in &quot;Hard Times&quot;.In this novel he lashes out against the dehumanization of our children through &quot;education&quot;, as well as the still very real gulf between the well to do and impoverished. Even the names of his characters are none-too-subtle jabs. The local teacher, Professor Gradgrind, seeks not to educate or enlighten, but to hammer home facts and turn his children into automatons. His counterpart in the business arena is Bounderby, a blustering, egomaniacal, and ultimately vacuous man. Their countermeasure is a young orphan girl named Sissy Jupe. She is a lovable character that embodies compassion and humanity, but is very nearly broken by the their overbearing influence.This is not a &quot;fun&quot; book to read, and if you're looking to be entertained in traditional Dickens fashion I strongly reccomend looking elsewhere (i.e. David Copperfield). The novel is relatively straightforward and simple of plot, and his scathing social commentary cannot be missed. The most compelling reason to read &quot;Hard Times&quot; though is the fact that the same mentality criticized here is still very much in existence today, and this makes the novel just as relevant for the 21st century as it was when first penned.",

Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn cold and grey.\"This novel is all about what one would think of as a dreary life in a north England mill town (fictitiously) called Coketown. It is named after the seemingly endless plumes of thick coal smoke being emitted from many different mills in this small lifeless town. But true to Dickens style he gives us a delightful set of characters that we can love or hate but who keep us entertained through a quick read of about 300 pages.There is method in the madness, in that Dickens tries to push us in the direction of accepting that fate was not preordained for these folks and they could choose a better life if they so desired. He includes many biblical references and references to the mid 1800 culture to keep it all upbeat and entertaining.I was expecting a more depressing plot to reflect the title \"Hard Times\", but in many ways it is good times for some of the characters, and as Dickens says at the end that he can hope for a positive outcome for their lives - the precise details of which he leaves us guessing.Entertaining 5 star read at a bargain price by a wonderful author.",

Also, every chapter is full of striking images. In addition, the suspense and dramatic irony are well placed. To be sure, many of Dickens' full length books such as &quot;Dombey &amp; Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853)are exquisite as well.

Its brevity contrasts with the longer works for which Dickens is more famous, and its satiric skewering of rampant capitalism leaves an imprint on the reader's mind not soon forgotten.Dickens holds up Thomas Gradgrind for us, Sir, a singular member of the industrial community of \"Coketown,\" a man who is so obsessed with Facts that he never allows his children to Feel. They are to \"discard the word Fancy altogether.\" To ensure this strict materialistic philosophy, the children are taught by a schoolmaster named \"McChoakumchild.\" In Gradgrind's friend Josiah Bounderby Dickens gives us possibly the most layered, complete and abhorrent hypocrite in all of English literature. Moliere's Tartuffe is the height of sincerity compared with Bounderby, who seems really to have convinced himself of his own myth after many years of browbeating others with his pompous false modesty. The fact that he is a factory owner who mercilessly exploits his workers only makes him the less endearing. And this is the man Tom Gradgrind gives his daughter to in marriage!The book's narrator clearly distinguishes the good guys from the bad guys, all in an effective effort to show that humans need to appreciate sentiment and sympathy much more than they need to worship dollars and cents.

To give encouragement to would-be Dickens' readers and Hard Times readers does seem like time well spent.Hard Times ventures from other Dickens' books in the writing style lending a departure from Dickens' previous descriptive formats. In this particular book, Dickens lends skill, imagination, and panache to English language usage. He breathes life in to the language of the novel, and he remains a master of dramatic setting and story line. When people say, \"Read good books, it will rub off on you.\" Hard Times comes first to my mind. Therefore, a reason to read Hard Times would be to improve your own reading and writing.I admit some of the character's lives are depressing. When I looked back upon the entire book, and wondered if Hard Times would differ if set in present day with cell phones, PDAs, the Internet, electricity, airplanes, automobiles, and so many distractions. My guess would be - probably not. Would Louisa Gradgrind's life have taken a different course if she were living in today's world? My guess would be, perhaps, a slight shift on her circumstances, and, again, probably not. Dickens' charms include being able to put his finger on a character type and bring it to life. This is why I'd call certain present day figures, \"A Mr. Bounderby\" or \"A Gradgrind\". The Whelp or Tom Gradgrind remains alive and kicking; I've met him.My recommendation: Read Hard Times. You will be a better reader and writer for it.",

You've got people living in wage slavery! You've got educators who can't raise their own children! You've got amoral, rakish aristocrats! You've got unprincipled politicians and businessmen! When Dickens is taking on each of these subjects individually in his other works, he's wonderful; when he sews up his complaints against them into one big bundle and convinces himself that it's a Social Theory, he's a tiresomely shrill satirist and all of his characters turn as flat as paper before one's very eyes.This doesn't, of course, mean that the book isn't worth reading - after all, it's Dickens. There are some very sweet and descriptively rich passages about a traveling circus and although one finds it difficult to give a hoot about any of the characters aside from Mr. Gradgrind (who might have been developed much more richly if Dickens had cut down on the windy deploring a little and worked harder to make him seem like less of a cipher) the plot thunders along at the usual absorbingly breathless pace.

The novel was originally published as a weekly series in \"Household Words\" periodical edited by Dickens. The novel reads quickly telling a story that is still relevant in our own post-industrial 21st century Western Society.The novel is set in fictional Coketown set in the English Midlands. The first scene is set in a classroom where children are being taught by rotelearning. Only FACTS yells Mr. Gradgrind who has raised his two children the feckless Tom and the more impressionable Louisa to eschew the emotions of art and the heart to stick strictly to practical learning.Enter into the town Mr. Sleary's circus. Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is a young girl whose father is employed by Sleary to ride horses. He deserts Sissy who is adopted by the Gradgrind family. Sissy befriends the lonely lass Louisa. Louisa is forced into a loveless marriage with the bloviating humbug industrialist Josiah Bounderby. Bounderby has crafted a false story of a difficult childhood while disdaining the love of his mother who lives in the country.We also met the tragic Stephen Blackpool a miner who is wed to an alocholic wife. Stephen is in love with the beautiful and kind Rachael. He will be framed for the robbery of Bounderby's bank which was really robbed by Tom Gradgrind.The novel is divided into three parts covering several years. Many of the characters come to a bad end. The novel attacks industrialism, the state of British education and the necessity for entertainment in the lives of everyone.All of Dickens fictions are worth reading. Hard Times is a good introduction to the second half of his career in which he moves to more serious themes. A Victorian classic which will be enjoyed by the discriminating reader.",

I didn't get quite the same connection with the characters as in Great Expectations - I can't readily recall their names after a few months - but I know them and can remember vividly the scenes that he painted them in.Again there are several sub plots which drive the point home and wrap the novel up in such a tight and well thought out way that only Dickens could have written this. The main character, for me, is Louisa, raised under conventional wisdom on only dry facts and reason. As such, she is completely unable to cope with real life. She is married to Bounderby, who owns the local bank while her brother, Tom, works for him. Bounderby claims to been raised in the gutter, abandoned by his parents, and to have raised himself up by his bootstraps. Each character has built for themselves a house of cards which are destined to come tumbling down revealing all the flaws, all the lies and the fundamental errors of their thinking. The only person left unscathed is the abandoned circus girl who, like Biddy in Great Expectations, reminds us that the people we overlook may just be the best ones out of the bunch.",

But the greatness of Dickens, it seems to me, is that each one of his novels conveys a feeling, envisions a world, that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This is especially true of Hard Times.The most common interpretation of the book is that it is anti-utilitarian. This take on the novel is quite true, to an extent, but to say that this stance constitutes all that the book concerns is, in itself, a utilitarian interpretation! It reduces the book to a fictionalised polemic. And the book is surely far more than that!There are always, in Dickens's works, depths opening up amidst the simple plots and the simplified (and whimsically named) characters that bring one to a stop. When Louisa finds out from her brother Tom that Bounderby (the most deliciously named character herein) is set to propose marriage to her, the chapter ends thusly:\"Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he has spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\"This passage alone should serve notice that something deeper is going in the world of Coketown. I truly don't think I can proffer to the prospective reader a glimpse of the depths that lie beneath the simplified characters and simplistic narrative structure than by quoting the last words of Stephen Blackpool, addressed to his Muse-like Rachael, as he lies dying, after having been raised from the disused mine opening known locally as Old Hell Shaft:\"I ha' fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o' old folk now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives - fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an' hundreds...When it were in work, it killed wi'out need: when `tis let alone, it kills wi'out need. See how we die an' no need, one way an' another - in a muddle - every day!\"Coketown, perhaps, resembles our own world a bit too much for our own comfort and self-satisfaction. Look at the tag on the shirt you are now wearing. It was most likely made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop by a human being, with hopes and dreams much like your own. More importantly, for the significance of this book, gaze out into the world around you where people die, \"thousands an' hundreds\" every day, for no particular reason other than that they fell in a sort of shaft or hole: financial, medical, physical.Why is Coketown, why is the world as it is, with no apparent rhyme or reason? Why is it, in short, a muddle? That is the deeper question which Hard Times leaves us mulling: Why must they always exist?",

          "comment": "It is unfortunate that HARD TIMES by Charles Dickens is not usually read outside the classroom. It is an unforgettable glimpse of an age that did not prize the worth of the individual over a collective society--sort of like today's emphasis on the same. What stamps HARD TIMES as the classic that it is is Dickens' continual focus on the rights of the individual and his championing of anti-child labor laws. In an age that routinely crushed individuals in the grinding gears of a society that was hell-bent on automating the factory system, it was only lone voices like Charles Dickens who, in his novels, cried out to stop the madness. In HARD TIMES, Dickens takes a savagely satirical poke at a then popular system of thought: utilitarianism, a philosophy which saw men and children as interchangeable cogs in a machine that demanded that all facets of life and output be reduced to facts, numbers, and quantifiable data. Thomas Gradgrind opens the novel by insisting that the students in his school be just like Officer Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot; fame: give me the facts, and only the facts. Those who can deliver advance. Those who cannot get routinely squashed flat. Josiah Bounderby is the villain as he represents the ultimate in a selfishness and fact-centeredness way of life. As typical of Dickens, there is a vast assortment of subplots that he manages to tie neatly together by the closing pages. What stamps HARD TIMES as relevant in this or any future age is Dickens' insistance that, regardless of technological advances, the individual will always matter. HARD TIMES says this as well as any other book.",

I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature.",

          "comment": "I think everyone can agree right from the start that \"Hard Times\" is not Charles Dickens's greatest work. It is certainly nothing compared to works of a similar length, such as \"Tale of Two Cities\" or \"Great Expectations.\" But even Dicken's lesser works are gems, although a bit less refined.The tale spreads across three households, the upright and serious Gradgrind family, the wealthy blowhard Joseph Bounderby of Coketown, and the dismal, poverty stricken Stephen Blackpool and his wretched, drunken wife. Gradgrind is all facts, and raises his children to be without imagination or wonder. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed self-made man is all appearances, having dragged himself out of the gutter into station. Blackpool is all honesty, unable to commit even the smallest wrong that would bring his own happiness.Into this mix are thrown two strays, the orphaned but lighthearted Sissy Jupe and the immoral and charismatic James Harthouse. They are the catalyst for the downfall of the orderly lives built by Gradgrind and Bounderby, and the further descent of Blackpool. No good deed goes unpunished in \"Hard Times,\" but neither does an ill deed go rewarded.Dickens's shortest novel, \"Hard Times\" is only a small investment of time to spend with such rich characters. Lacking the light-hearted balance from his longer novels, the short length is a relief as too much more dreariness could be an undoing. At the same time, a deeper exploration of the lives and philosophies of the storyline would have made for a richer experience.",

The writing is evocative and fluid, and although it can be easy to get lost due to some of the anachronisms in Dickens' writing, in general the writing is excellent. The characters, while not subtle (it's pretty easy to sum them up in a few words) are all memorable and tug on the heartstrings quite a bit. Sissy, Mr. Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby, Stephen, Tom, and Louisa are great characters (and just because they're easily defined, they are no less human or believable). Finally, the story itself is a bit sobering (as it was intended to be) but it's also very human and shows the possibilities of redemption quite nicely.In short, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is excellent. I'd recommend it to any fan of Dickens or just anybody who likes good literature.",

Also, there is very little subtlety here; Dickens has a point (facts are not everything; there is more to life than practicality) and he hammers that point home repeatedly, making little effort to allow the reader to feel clever for having discerned the author's point. Most of the characters are caricatures, with the possible exception of Louisa; this is a flaw not unusual in Dickens' writing, but it seems more noticable and blatant here than in some of his better stories.Worth reading, but not excellent.",

His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks.

      "description": "Twenty-five years ago, at the height of the counter-culture movement, several hundred hippies drove their school buses into southern Tennessee and founded America's largest, modern-day intentional community, The Farm. In its heyday, the community was home to over 1,200 optimistic young people and the young-at-heart. Their purpose for coming together was to experiment with alternative lifestyles that could help raise the standard of living for impoverished people around the world while conserving the planet's resources. The results of these experiments were not always predictable, but were always interesting, and created lasting bonds among community members that are still strong today. The Farm remains a vibrant, working environment for change. Why has it lasted so long? Discover the answers as members past and present recount some of their more memorable experiences.",

          "comment": "For an introduction to or a refresher course in the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, readers would do well to invest in Felix Markham's 270-page mini-biography &quot;Napoleon&quot;, published in 1963. Succinct it definitely is, which means that military campaigns requiring a great deal of detail tend to be a little dry, while Napoleon's coronation (depicted by David as one of the great spectacles in the first half of the 19th Century) is covered by Markham in a few brush strokes. The true value of the book, aside from its synopsis of a dazzling history, is Markham's incisive study of Napoleon's personality and the enormous effect he had on his generation as well as those to come. Junot is quoted as saying: &quot;He is the sort of man of whom nature is sparing and who only appears on earth at intervals of centuries.&quot; Napoleon's wisdom as an administrator is set against his occasional brutality, as when he had 3,000 prisoners shot to death at Jaffa or somewhat arbitrarily ordered the execution of the Duc d'Enghien. (It was the latter act that caused Beethoven to cross out the &quot;Eroica&quot; dedication.) Markham debunks some Napoleonic myths, including my favorite that Napoleon subsisted on only four hours of sleep per day, plus power naps. And for those of us who think of Napoleon's rise to power as an unobstructed arc of triumph, Markham reminds us that in the early part of his career Napoleon came more than once under the shadow of the guillotine. There are 38 illustrations and, like the text, they provide a sort of pr&eacute;cis of this extraordinary life. The portraits of Napoleon from the 1790's depict him in dramatic poses, his hair blowing in the wind, very much like a 1940's movie star. These contrast sadly with the St Helena pictures, the ex-Emperor leaning on a spade in his garden, looking tamed and resigned. From triumphant Emperor to tired exile, Felix Markham presents a &quot;Napoleon&quot; that is short but strong.",

      "description": "This doctor still makes house calls. In 1990, Dr. Linnea Smith went on vacation. The result? She abandoned a thriving medical practice in Wisconsin to serve the Yagua Indians in the deepest part of the Amazon rainforest of Peru alone. Today, Dr. Smith routinely hears the midnight cry of \"Doctora!\" from patients facing life-and-death emergencies. Accompany her on house calls where the unknown often awaits. Observe how she treats exotic diseases, alligator bites and complicated births almost a day's journey away from the closest hospital. Taken straight from the pages of Dr. Smith's journal, La Doctora offers readers a rare glimpse into the suspense and drama of practicing medicine in a culture far removed from the sophisticated supplies and supports of 20th-century medicine. Learn how Dr. Smith evolved from a \"strange white woman\" to an adopted member of the indigenous community. Her story of adventure, self-discovery and service creates an inspirational testimonial to one person's power to make a lasting difference.",

          "comment": "This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin, the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea), am interested in Latin American culture, and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses, she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician, after all, not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking, and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably, but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships, we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive, some die, but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general, and a book in a similar vein, that of a doctor practicing &quot;backwoods medicine&quot; that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea, in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous, extremely outstanding work, is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this, I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there, revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the &quot;problem&quot; can be seen right in her acknowledgements, when, regarding her publishers, she writes that they &quot;gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.&quot; Sorry, but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician, not a professional writer, and though this effort is quite passable, it could have been so much better.The book is informative, educational up to a point, gives a good perspective on &quot;jungle&quot; medicine&quot; vs. the US mainstream practice thereof, and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced, when she said that the inhabitants, almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty, &quot;seemed happy.&quot; This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who, many contended &quot;seemed happy.&quot;) There are a few funny moments, especially when Dr. Linnea describes w/ dead-on accuracy her encounters with the Peruvian bureaucracy, redtape and corruption.All in all, well worth reading, but don't expect great emotional engagement or gripping human drama.",

It's hard to know how these descriptions will play out in the mind's eye of other readers.

She really likes what she is doing. The book confirms this.When you read this book you are looking inside La Doctora. Nothing is hidden. There are no pretenses. She is simply good people.Incidently, she wanted the book named &quot;At the River's Edge&quot; and the publishers wanted &quot;La Doctora&quot;. The publishers won.",

Huxley is not quite able to deliver here. In short: in comparison to Brave New World, which is a masterly critique of the way things are headed (I strongly recommend supplementing with BNW Revisited), this vision of what things might be pales.This book is built as a dialogue between the West (Farnaby) and various elements of a better society (characters of Pala). Many of the conversations are outstanding and revealing. Huxley obviously had a great intuitive feel for humans and their trajectory when operating in a Western, consumer driven system. There are many great insights that you will literally not find in any other work. I think most books of Huxley are worth reading for these revelations alone. This is not to say that he is an infallible sage type. For example, he recommends hormonally modifying youngsters if they are too \"muscle bound\" or \"inferior\". Then we wouldn't have such a risk of psychopathic dictators... Not sure he truly appreciated man's lust for greed and his boundless capacity for self-delusion.However, as Huxley alludes to himself,he is not the great poet that can thrill us with harmonious language and thrilling plot. While the middle sections move well, the beginning and conclusion are hard to follow with any passionate interest. Sir Thomas Moore's \"Utopia\" was far more engaging because of the great humor and satirical elements employed. Huxley must surely be lacking in a sense of humor, a deficit which is sorely missed when such a grave topic is handled.In conclusion, this book is a must read. I only wish Huxley stuck with more of a non-fiction approach, as his contemporary Bertrand Russell wrote in because he is a direct writer and incredibly logical.

I believe Will Faranby was both a protagonist and a antagonist, but thats open to interpretation. Huxley wrote this book giving the reader an opportunity to see how spirituality shapes and impacts a persons perception of him/herself (the being) and the world. The book centered around the progression of Will Faranby's introspective of consciousness. Huxley incorporated hallucinogenics aka moksha-medicine as being totally appropriate and relevant to the characters development, thus solidifying Farnaby's introspective of himself. In essence, the moksha-medicine was an eye-opening, yet intense experience that ultimately gave the main character a deeper awareness to the world and his own personal existence (the being).",

          "comment": "Whew, am I glad to be finished with this book. It was very heavy reading, and boring as well. I'm glad I did read it, just so I know what it's all about, since it is a well-known classic by a famous author. But I'm so glad to be done, it was a real slog to get through.It is the antithesis of *Brave New World*, a Utopian vision rather than a Dystopian one. The thing is, it is only very thinly disguised as a novel. Except for the main character, there's not a lot of character development, and practically no plot at all. Nothing happens except at the very beginning and very end (and even then, not much.)What it really is, is a discussion of Huxley's theory of what it would take to create Utopia. If this is something you are passionately interested in, and you are reading it as such rather than as a novel, you would perhaps appreciate it. The story mainly consists of the main character going around touring an island country while different residents explain all the elements that make their society so ideal. It is a series of highly abstract, esoteric discussions mainly of philosophy and spirituality, told in \"appropriate\" weighty language (i.e., the heaviness of the language is apparently intended to convey the seriousness of the subject. In case we don't get that.)I didn't buy Huxley's vision, either. Many of the foundations he proposes for the building of a Utopia are either realistically impossible, almost childishly naive and pie-in-the-sky, or both. For example, magic mushrooms whose effects are only vaguely described (to me it appeared that all they did was get people stoned to the point of hallucination) but were essential to impart transcendence and make a person \"fully human.\" And being able to identify and cure young children who would otherwise grow up to be violent, sociopathic, self-destructive, etc. And getting everyone over the age of 15 to practice Tantric sex, and only Tantric sex. (Can you imagine a 15-year-old boy being able to do that, or even wanting to try?) True, these impossibilities are supposedly excused by being under the umbrella of fiction, but the actual result is that the book doesn't really succeed as either fiction OR nonfiction.I was also put off by Huxley's unadulterated and open contempt for anyone who was overweight. And by his (perhaps unconscious) apparent pedophilia. I wish I'd kept a tally of how many times he ecstatically described the breasts of pubescent girls (naturally, they were always bare in his utopia.) I'm betting such descriptions would number in the double digits.The one thing I did like about this book was that when he wasn't being portentously weighty, Huxley's descriptions are gorgeous and lyrical. For example, I loved the care-crows (scarecrows) and the Japanese Hornpipe dance.If you've never read Aldous Huxley before, I recommend giving this a skip and reading *Brave New World* instead. That one is quite interesting. It's hard to believe the two books were written by the same person.(286 pages)I did get some good quotes from *Island*:\"Both of us victims of the same twentieth-century plague. Not the Black Death this time; the Grey Life.\"\"I have a theory that, whenever little boys and girls are systematically flagellated, the victims grow up to think of God as 'Wholly Other' -- isn't that the fashionable *argot* in your part of the world? Wherever, on the contrary, children are brought up without being subjected to physical violence, God is immanent. A people's theology reflects the state of its children's bottoms.\"\". . . she was slowly, and with a great deal of pain, put to death in solitude. In solitude . . . For of course nobody can help, nobody can ever be present. People may stand by while you're suffering and dying; but they're standing by in another world. In *your* world you're absolutely alone. Alone in your suffering and your dying, just as you're alone in love, alone even in the most completely shared pleasure.\"",

          "comment": "Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this book is the apparently wholehearted acceptance that its dated and dangerous ideas seem to have found, at least as evidenced by a cursory reading of the reviews. What in the world gives Huxley the right to revise civilization? The fact that he is well-read? His adoption of discredited oriental philosophies?It cannot be argued that Western Civilization is without room for much improvement; however, abandonment of family, use of \"mind-expanding\" drugs, renunciation of religion, modification of accepted societal behavior, repudiation of long-standing definitions of acceptable sexual conduct, etc. These have all been tried to some extent and have universally failed. Huxley merely puts a fine gloss on the 20th Century's disdain of tried and true principles.Strong families supported by public morality and high expectations with respect to ethical behavior are the means whereby society will advance. History has proven this to be the case. It is no accident that English has become the language of the world--despite its many flaws, the rule of law and its protections of freedom and private property have given us the world we now, apparently, seek to destroy.Huxley and his ilk would have us believe that our civilization is so inherently superior to all others that we are free to ignore the lessons of history. However, it is more likely than not that humanity's basic nature remains the same today as hundreds of years ago. For example, regardless of your religious persuasions and beliefs, one must acknowledge that the Jewish culture has proven remarkably adaptive and has a longevity that is the envy of any cultural group--they have kept their people together through thousands of years of history by following some simple rules that Mr. Huxley would throw out the window.Despite the superficial attractiveness of Huxley's easy philosophy, hard work and obedience to laws will paradoxically produce far more freedom than a slothful abandonment to what feels good.",

That being said, this book is absolutely, unequivocably horrible. It is 354 pages of plotless, repetitive socio-preach. Mr. Huxley's \"A Brave New World\" is, in my opinion, one of the best novels ever written. \"Island\" does not rise to that same level, though, and I would not wish it upon anyone.",

          "comment": "I kept reading this book because on some level I was just waiting for something to happen. There were a couple of conflicts that could come to head somehow and make the book interesting in the \"I'm reading a fictional narrative sort of way\". However, none of these became more than hints until the very last two pages of the book. When this happens it seems like some predetermined anticlimax that you have been waiting for all along. The book fails as a narrative which is a problem when the publishers want to sell it as fiction.The problem is that it is not a work of fiction but is more a work of philosophy as story. I kept thinking ofCandideorGulliver's Travels (Oxford World's Classics). The problem is that Voltaire and Swift's works were at the bottom much more interestingly told. Island is the vehicle for Huxley to lay out his real utopia devised after a lifetime of intellectual work. The protagonist and the reader are guided around the island to learn about the pro-Buddhist, pro-hallucinatory drug, pro-sex, and anti(capitalist, communist, consumption, western education, nuclear family, etc) philosophy.This journey, as the protagonist learns and starts to internalize the teachings of the island, comes to an end based on the forces that represent the bad in the world. Poor Huxley's utopia even though isolated from the world cannot survive as the very nature of the philosophy is non-violent and acquiescent. It contains the seeds of its own destruction. I cannot help but think how much Huxley hated modernity and hoped for and sought a world beyond this one in the form of religion and drugs. For him, the struggle was not about the control of the means of production, but whether the means of production should exist. I just think he should thank his stars that he did not live to see the Brave New World in the flower as we can see it.",

          "comment": "\"Attention!\" cries the talking bird at the end of the book when tiny Pala, the island utopia its inhabitants have tried so diligently to perfect and stay apart from the world, is finally overrun via military intervention and a sellout within. The references to the birds, probably mynas or macaws in a tropical setting, screeching this admonition occurs throughout the plot and usually occurs as part of spiritual exhortations. But it was this final exhortation that woke me up at the end of the book, at the culmination of the final chapter which is one of the most beautifully written conclusions I have ever read. It was as if Huxley was saying to the reader \"wake up!!!\" before our own personal island, i.e. ourselves, our souls, our identities, etc. are overtaken by a ravenous and consuming outside world.This is what I take Island to really mean: as a metaphor for the person as individual. We each are islands in the vast ocean of life; we should take very good care of ourselves and intentionally preserve and enhance our freedom, morality, spirituality and our autonomy lest we be consumed and overrun, a la Pala, by an uncaring, spirituality bankrupt and pillaging world without. Some reviews have suggested Pala as Huxley's depiction of a utopia counterposed against Brave New World. That is all well and good but, in the end, the utopia of Pala doesn't make it either. I believe Huxley was too cynical and suspicious of modern life to ever suspect a utopia could long survive en masse. What he did promote, in various forms of expression, was a profound concern for individual freedom in a world populated by tyranny, totalitarian forces in varous shapes and mass market commercialism collectively sucking all the vitality and beauty out of human existence.Huxley was a great humanist and proponent of extending human freedom and potential wherever possible and combating any force arrayed against that effort. He early on experimented with drugs as a means, I believe, of expanding human experience and expression. In many respects he was the precursor to Timothy Leary and the LSD movement, the hippie generation, the New Agers, the green movement in general and other groups concerned with the human condition arrayed against tyranny, dogmatism and capitalism run amok. Island is the literary culmination of his lifelong work and is a profound, astute and deeply mystical book. Easily one of the best I have ever read.It is little noted that Huxley, prior to his serious writing career and Brave New World, once taught French to English schoolboys. One of his students was none other than Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, the future author of 1984. It is one of the great ironies of modern life that one English classroom could have housed at one time the two great geniuses of the twentieth century, in terms of political satire, whose combined dystopias portrayed a future world so nightmarish and inhumane that it jolted humankind into thought and action, providing inestible service. Did Huxley inspire Orwell in his thought at that early stage or with Brave New World later? Who knows, nonetheless Huxley was a magnificent thinker and profoundly influential figure of the twentieth century. His Island, equal to Brave New World in my opinion, fittingly crowns his eventful life prior to his death a year later.Other reviewers have more than adequately summarized the plot. For me, the talking birds say it all.",

          "comment": "Huxley gives us a lot to ponder in his \"utopian\" schemata. His satirical and humorous protagonist, Farnaby, was hilarious. His snide comments and thoughts made me laugh out loud at times. I felt Huxley's writing style was much clearer and more accessible than A Brave New World and as a result I liked Island much better. Island reflects a great deal of cynicism about America and the world. Huxley attacks, among other things (1) consumerism; (2) the cold war ideology of both the capitalistic west and the socialist east; (3) religious suppression of the right of others to develop and practice their own sexual and other \"private\" mores and the use of the state to further this suppression; (4) violence and militarism clothed in religion, progress (technological and moral), and so called freedom; (5) political and social corruption of corporatism and the power of corporations and those that control them to use their resources for political power.The key point I feel Huxley makes is that capitalistic or corporate power in the west is able to use it vast resources to obtain what it desires. Corporate power uses money, religion, and the greed of the State to pursue its ends. Had the leaders of Pala given into greed then the Island would not have suffered its eventual fate at the hands of an outside force--but would have suffered an erosion of its \"utopian\" nature and everyone except the greedy would have lost in the end anyway. But either way it is clear that the corporate interests will take what it desires and use the tools of religious fervor and state power to further their own ends. Its key resource, however, is still MONEY---and in pursuit of what?----more MONEY. The happiness of everyday citizens is sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed.Island was published in 1962 and really reflects Huxley's views, I suspect, of the latter half of the 1950's. Interestingly, the 1950's are marked by (1) the true rise of consumerism and corporate exploitation of American demand for goods; (2) entrenchment of the Cold War and suppression of individual rights and free thought based on ideological extremism (McCarthy, Hoover, John Foster Dulles, Castro, and Stalin are all towering figures of the 1950s); (3) the emerging battle and public expression of a new set of sexual mores which met a backlash by conservative/religious segments of society; (4) The emergence of cold war capitalism fueled both by American defense corporations and the attempt of the Soviet Union to catch up with the west in terms of industrialization and military might (Eisenhower, during his Presidency, warned of the might of the military industrial complex). Some argue the entire cold war was generated by the greed of American defense industries (this is far-fetched in my opinion).The scary thing about all this--the same set of circumstances can be said to have exit today, despite the end of the cold war. Certainly, the power of corporations to dominate the political agenda and decision making process is still intact. Whether this limits or threatens individual liberties and democracy is another question. Certainly it did in the 1950's in America. It is amazing to me the correlation between the 1950's and the 1980's at the height of the cold war in American History. (For more information on the 1950's in this country I would recommend a perusal of David Halberstam's The 1950's). Huxley's book is as timely and poignant today as it was in 1962. The right or ability of an individual and a society to choose how it is going to live and progress is as impeded today as it was in the early 1960's---and by the same forces.Some rogue comments:1. I found the discussion of \"maithuna\" or the \"yoga of love\" to be quite humorous. I especially liked Farnaby's snide thought \"What shall be do to be saved? The answer is in four letters\". Is there really such a thing as \"maithuna\"?2. The use of mind altering drugs for experiencing a different slice of reality was provocative. Huxley wrote a book called \"The Doors of Perception\" which I have not read. I found these elements of the book to be interesting and really wanted more explication on the subject.3. The commentary on population control was also quite timely then and now. This exchange I found quite clear and commonsensical:Farnaby: \"You seem to have solved your economic problems [on the Island] pretty successfully\".Dr. Robert: \"Solving them wasn't difficult. To begin with, we never allowed ourselves to produce more children than we could feed, clothe, house, and educate into something like full humanity\".4. One of the scary pitfalls of the book is the Island's use of psychological drugs to control and shape the personality of its children so they don't grow up to be problems. Huxley, I felt, placed too much trust in science and medicine in this instance. This seemed to me like something not out of a peaceful utopian society but \"A Clockwork Orange\" (see p. 154-155 of the Perennial Library paperback edition for the reference-about 2/3rds into chapter 9).5. I know little about Buddhism and Yoga so those parts of the books I did not get as much out of, although I found them of interest. I wonder why he chose forms of these religions as those most applicable to his utopia as opposed to atheism or some form of spiritualistic religion other than Buddhism?One last comment: The ending was perfect in its cynicism.

She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others. She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: \"The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone.\" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty. Lanterns is illustrated with thirty of the author's personal photographs and includes \"A Parent's Pledge\" and \"Twenty-five More Lessons for Life,\" an inspiration to all of us-parents, grandparents, teachers, religious and civic leaders-to guide, protect, and love our children every day so that they will become, in Marian Wright Edelman's moving vision, the healing agents for national transformation.",

      "description": "An extremely moving account of the lonely life of the unloved and tragic genius - described as \"the greatest modern Italian poet\" 'Love me, by God; I need love, love, love, fire, enthusiasm, life. The world does not seem made for me' Giacomo Leopardi, considered the greatest Italian poet since Dante, was one of the most radical thinkers of the nineteenth century. He also regarded himself one of the most miserable and unfortunate people to have lived. Born to strict parents in a provincial town in 1798, he had a lonely childhood, and he spent his time largely in his father's library. He suffered from a debilitating illness, and his short life was full of pain. But this pain and misery gave rise to some of the most intense and brilliant poems ever written in the Italian language. In this poetic biography, Iris Origo, author of the bestselling War in Val d'Orcia traces the short and lonely life of this conflicted poet. Written with generosity and understanding, A Study in Solitude is a sharp, moving portrait of a frail and frustrated genius. Iris Origo (1902-1988) was a British-born biographer and writer. She lived in Italy and devoted much of her life to the improvement of the Tuscan estate at La Foce, which she purchased with her husband in the 1920s. During WWII, she sheltered refugee children and assisted many escaped Allied prisoners of war and partisans in defiance of Italy's fascist regime and Nazi occupation forces. Pushkin Press also publishes her war diaries, War in Val d'Orcia, her memoir, Images and Shadows, as well as another of her biographies, The Last Attachment.",

Voor mij is het even belangrijk als het dagboek van Anne Frank.' - Steve McQueen Solomon Northup, in 1808 als vrij man geboren in New York, wordt in 1841 ontvoerd en in het Zuiden verkocht als slaaf. Twaalf jaar lang werkt hij op plantages in Louisiana, vaak onder de meest wrede omstandigheden, altijd in de hoop zijn vrijheid terug te winnen. In 1853 komt Northup eindelijk vrij. In datzelfde jaar verschijnt 12 jaar slaaf, zijn eigen aangrijpende relaas van zijn gevangenschap in een van de donkerste periodes uit de Amerikaanse geschiedenis. Het boek slaat direct in als een bom en opent vele Amerikanen de ogen voor de onmenselijkheid van het slavernijsysteem. 12 Years a Slave is verfilmd door de Britse filmmaker Steve McQueen en werd geproduceerd door onder anderen Brad Pitt. De film won de Golden Globe voor Beste Film en is genomineerd voor negen Oscars, waaronder die voor Beste Film. Het boek verschijnt voor het eerst in Nederlandse vertaling.

What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer).

I do believe he is crazy and should not be out walking around, but, still, something about him makes me want to try to figure out how his mind works and why it works the way it does.Manson In His Own Words was a little bit helpful. Honestly, I don't know how much of it is accurate. The author Nuel Emmons says himself that he did not have a tape recorder or pencil or paper during the conversations, so he had to go by memory, writing things down when he returned to his car. That alone tells me that there is probably more of Mr. Emmons thoughts' or feelings than Charlie.Reading about his childhood was heartbreaking. Imagine your own mother trading you as a child for a pitcher of beer. Your own mother turning you over to the courts because she didn't want to take care of you. Being in foster homes, reform schools and jail since you were twelve years old. Being abused in those places mentally, physically and sexually. How can that not have a negative effect on anyone?Charles Manson definitely has a screw loose, but is he the evil incarnate that the media has made him out to be? Again, you have to read this with an open mind and take what is written with a grain of salt. I am not real sure how much of what Charlie says is reliable, but it was a very interesting perspective from what is supposed to be his point of view.Full Disclosure: Originally posted on Blog Critics",

The author who is the \"voice of Manson\" for this book is an ex-prison buddy of Manson, prior to the slayings of Sharon Tate etc. The author, Nuel Emmons portrays Manson as a victim of society. I finished reading it thinking it was almost entirely a book of excuses for why Manson did what he did. There is no doubth that he was a victim of a horrible upbringing and a corrupt jail system. However, the book did not answer a lot of questions I was hoping it would. With that being said it is a different perspective on the Manson story and I highly recommend it to those only if they have already or plan on reading other Manson books such as Helter Skelter etc. I am waiting for the new Manson book to be released in November 2010. It should be a good one. Regards.",

Not even a few chapters into the book, and I could tell that Manson is as distorted in his perceptions of his own actions as he is accurately perceptive of other people's personalities, especially their vulnerabilities. It is little wonder to me that he holds such a fixation on the public mind (for the character of his terribleness), as well as the individual minds of his fanatics (for what they must perceive as something prophetic), and yet it is difficult to pinpoint precisely what it is about him that gives him this ambiance. After reading this, I discredited the opinion that Manson was so manipulative that he could literally control minds and actions of his followers. Were he such a mastermind, I'd say he would never have been caught. What I took away was how his perspective on life can somehow be infectious to those who let themselves listen. What's more, I think he appeals naturally to people who feel helpless, pained, and who are very vulnerable (and I am of the opinion that helplessness and pain are far too common across the population). What appals me more than anything is Manson's ready willingness to justify (to himself) his using other people for his own self-aggrandized objectives. People who have the insight into other's suffering, and who use that insight to take advantage of that suffering is also something I think is far too common across the population.",

Strapped to horses and donkeys, Francis and others were taken north into lives of slavery under wealthy Muslim farmers.

      "description": "Part of the Jewish Encounter series Poet, warrior, and king, David has loomed large in myth and legend through the centuries, and he continues to haunt our collective imagination, his flaws and inconsistencies making him the most approachable of biblical heroes. Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate of the United States, plumbs the depths of David’s life: his triumphs and his failures, his charm and his cruelty, his divine destiny and his human humiliations. Drawing on the biblical chronicle of David’s life as well as on the later commentaries and the Psalms—traditionally considered to be David’s own words—Pinsky teases apart the many strands of David’s story and reweaves them into a glorious narrative. Under the clarifying and captivating light of Pinsky’s erudition and imagination, and his mastery of image and expression, King David—both the man and the idea of the man—is brought brilliantly to life.",

Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them.

It took turning to a page just about in the middle of the book, (page 109 to be exact), and reading from there for a few pages before going back to the beginning to understand this woman's philosophies, and where she's coming from.After that, from beginning to end I didn't want to close the book. Anyone who advocates for children wins me over, before and after all else. Of course there is much more to Sister Souljah's autobiography than the children she crusades for; she had to go through some things before reaching a platform from which she could stage her fight to help empower disenfranchised children.Other spots that engaged me as well; her relationship with her family, and as well other relationships... Nathan (of course being the premier), but also Joseph...(Sonya's spiel was truly potent), and Chance I just adored...at first! And that incident in Baltimore had me in stitches. Oh, that was one of a special kind of hilarious. Nikki was interesting, and also that talk on lesbianism with Mona. Tusani, and her mother Nita, just may have been the most stirring. It was the message behind the mother's message that I found tremendous; one where although it wasn't written, I felt wasn't lost on Sister Souljah either--the other thing I found impressive...her openness to hear what the people she was trying to help, and as well all of those she forged relationships with, were saying.I highly recommend `No Disrespect.' I really want to go on and on here, but in summary this work is as compassionate as it is passionate, intellectual, and outstanding.",

Completed in 1941, the 45,000-ton German battleship sank HMS Hood, the pride of the British Navy, during one of the most sensational encounters in naval history. Following the sinking, Bismarck was chased around the North Atlantic by many units of the Royal Navy. She was finally dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes on 27 May, less than five months after her completion. Her wreck still lies where she sank, 4,800m down and 960km off the west coast of France. Drawing on new research and technology, this edition is the most comprehensive examination of Bismarck ever published. It includes a complete set of detailed line drawings with fully descriptive keys and full-colour 3D artwork, supported by technical details, photographs and text on the building of the ship and a record of the ship's service history.",

      "author": "Thomas Paine",
      "rate": "0.8/5",
      "description": "Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",

Sadly this warning has been ignored and we see the result.I advise the everyone, partially Americans, to read this book with an open mind and other works written by your founding fathers, you may find that the wisdom of these good and clever men an antidote to the half truths on CNN and the rest of the corporate owned media.",

      "rate": "4.4/5",
      "description": "Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996, a big volume collecting all his shorter writings organized by subject. The themes he chose reflected his lifelong concerns: war, history, law, class, means and ends, and race. Throughout his life Zinn had returned again and again to these subjects, continually probing and questioning yet rarely reversing his convictions or the vision that informed them. The result was The Zinn Reader. Five years later, starting with Howard Zinn on History, updated editions of sections of that mammoth tome were published in inexpensive stand-alone editions. This second edition of Howard Zinn on History brings together twenty-seven short writings on activism, electoral politics, the Holocaust, Marxism, the Iraq War, and the role of the historian, as well as portraits of Eugene Debs, John Reed, and Jack London, effectively showing how Zinn’s approach to history evolved over nearly half a century, and at the same time sharing his fundamental thinking that social movements—people getting together for peace and social justice—can change the course of history. That core belief never changed. Chosen by Zinn himself as the shorter writings on history he believed to have enduring value—originally appearing in newspapers like the Boston Globe or the New York Times; in magazines like Z, the New Left, the Progressive, or the Nation; or in his book Failure to Quit—these essays appear here as examples of the kind of passionate engagement he believed all historians, and indeed all citizens of whatever profession, need to have, standing in sharp contrast to the notion of \"objective\" or \"neutral\" history espoused by some. \"It is time that we scholars begin to earn our keep in this world,\" he writes in \"The Uses of Scholarship.\" And in \"Freedom Schools,\" about his experiences teaching in Mississippi during the remarkable \"Freedom Summer\" of 1964, he adds: \"Education can, and should, be dangerous.\"",

He saw the baby boom part of the twentieth century history evolve before his eyes with major events, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the further activism that occurred thereafter, and the effects of the war on Vietnam with archival work, to name a few. HOWARD ZINN ON HISTORY is a collection of essays and articles previously published in notable journals and magazines, such as the Midwestern Archivist and Saturday Review. Zinn examines topics that have affected him academically as well as personally, and appear somewhat out dated but timeless at the same time because of how much has progressed from the time he originally wrote the pieces.The book may serve as a teaching tool for a political or American history classes because of its small format. It is the type of book that will raise questions for the casual history reader as well as the any history major. However, there are serious political overtones that resonate with the majority of the essays that may suggest Zinn's revisionist perspective on history, but he exposes the study of history and the sum of its parts. Zinn states: \"The scholar may swear to his neutrality on the job, but whether he be physicist, historian, or archivist, his work will tend, in this theory, to maintain the existing social order by perpetuating its values, by legitimizing its priorities, by justifying its wars, perpetuating its prejudices, contributing to its xenophobia, and apologizing for its class order\" (p. 167).Zinn opens the door to history as well as an inquiry into how it is shaped and formed. He probes important topics that have often been overlooked, which raises important questions, what can be considered history, and how long does it take to be history?",

And we are lucky to be allowed a peek into the workings (or no workings) of the British colonies. I was born and bred in Karachi and I can attest to the many goods and bads which were left by British empire. The railways remain their biggest contribution to Pakistan, as far as I can see. And they left those high handed bureaucrats, who were supposed to be good but have turned out badly. British gave us a certain system but they also destroyed and help eliminate many of the hand made products including hand made silk linen, which was the best in the world and was produced in Bengal region. To promote their own merchandise and machinery, British banned the making of this wonderful fabric, whose 7 yards could be packed within a cigarette packet.The most unfortunate legacy of British empire in Subcontinent (Pakistan, Bengal, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma) is the profusion of religious madrassahas (schools of Islamic law and jurisprudence) which created multiple religious thought processes including the violent ideology of Deobandi school. They were actively supported by British over-lords and we can see the results today: From Afghanistan to Pakistan and beyond the entire region is engulfed in the religious hatred flames.Back to the book: It is wonderfully written and he gets his facts straight.",

A century ago the Empire spanned the globe, hundreds of islands, dozens of countries and protectorates and the sun truly never set on the territories. But the Empire shrunk and collapsed in on itself yet straggling islands across the planet still lay claim or are claimed by the shadow of day's long gone.Sure, as other people have said, it's a dated book. But it was written in 1985 and reading it with that in mind it's a fascinating travelogue. I loved the author's attempt to \"invade\" Diego Garcia accompanied by the disappointing story of how residents were evicted and the U.S. put in a major (nuclear) base. The empire has done so many things in its best interest, unfortunately that doesn't always include protecting individual rights.I also learned a lot about St. Helena where exiles resided for decades (Napoleon, Mbelini - head of the Zulu Nation). I knew nothing about the beauty of the island or of the mansion where Napoleon took his walks and dictated his memoirs, staff on hand and British Guards out of sight.The Pitcairn islands are the last refuge of Britain in the Pacific not even administered nearby, but instead thousands of miles away from Australia. The resident population shrinking and forgotten. The average British citizen doesn't know much about its current empire. Maybe if you ask they'll say the Isle of Mann or the Faulklands. But these Outposts are historic and present. It's a great read. I love learning the minutia of history: the forgotten places, the discarded histories, and the neglected peoples.Dated? Maybe, but is history ever dated and does travel lose its romance.- CV Rick, March 2008",

Some of these outposts are in the middle of nowhere and you wonder how people live.I think the chapter I most enjoyed was Gibraltar - only because I know all about the roundabout trip British citizens have to make from getting from Spain to The Rock. (Okay - maybe that was the funny section.) My second favourite section was the Falklands (or should I say Malvinas?) -- I vaguely remember the war and it was nice to get a history lesson from this book. I'm sure my friends in the UK know more about this conflict that I do - but I don't remember a lot of news coverage here in the USA. (Granted, it's 20 years ago, but still - if it's not affecting the USA, the news kind of just skates over it quickly, if it's mentioned at all.)It's fine writing, makes you think about places that you might never otherwise heard of, but at times it's dull and reads more like a history text than a travelogue.",

Remnick manages to convey the views of the liberals who want to democratize the country and the neo-Stalinist conservatives who want to turn the clock back to the repression of life under Stalin.The author has little sympathy for Mikhail Gorbachev who once he launched \"perestroika\" could not make the final commitment to democracy and republicanism and remained trapped in the dying and corrupt Communist Party. Yet, Gorbachev's half-hearted attempts at reform nearly ended in a disasterous rigt-wing coup. Only, the incompetence of the plotters and will of the people not to turn back to a corrupt failed system prevented the USSR in falling back into despotism.Because of \"glasnost and perestroika\" Remnick was able to obtain candid views from everyone he interviewed during his stay in the Soviet Union. Miners, dissident and even communist party apparatchiks spoke freely about the good and bad of Russia. Nearly, 50 years after his death, Stalin's shadow still hovered over everything and everyone in the nation. Liberals such as Andrei Sakharov wanted the government and the party to fully acknowledge the heinous attrocities of mass murder and imprisonments committed during Stalin's reign, Khrukhschev made a tentative start at 20th party congress in denouncing Stalin but failed to follow through with real reform. During the Brezhnev years the country lurched backwards thast by the time Gorbachev came to power the Soviet Union was totally morally, politically and economically bankrupt.Remnick also does a fine job showing the first hesitant steps toward capitalism yet evenn today 10 years after the Soviet Union collapsed Russia still refuses to make the fundamental changes to bring a market economy fully to fruition. Under the Communists there was \"equity in poverty\" today in Russia you see the extremes of rich and poor. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the demise of the Soviet Union, but it needs an update to encompass the last decade.",

Remnick shows a society led by decades of fear - citizens who feared persecution and leaders who feared the loss of power. The author flows easily from dissecting the Communist party and power brokers of Soviet society to eating cabbage with Siberian miners who don't expect to live past 35 to intense discussions with the Russian intelligentsia who fought the system quietly and desperately. It is a long book and at times I found myself needing a Russian history reference guide. But Remnick is not writing a history filled with facts and statistics. It is all about the people. Lenin's Tomb should be read by any journalist who feels the urge to go beyond 8 graphs. Truly wonderful.",

          "comment": "Remnick's book is easily the most graphic and accurate account in English of the Gorbachev years between 1985 and 1991. It is unlikely to be surpassed. I judge his accuracy from his account of the August 1991 putsch, which is excellent given the information that was available. As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup', KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents, I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President, who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service, at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6, and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets, which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria, I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff, and his book does so nicely.",

          "comment": "This is one of the very best book on the Luftwaffe by serious, academic historian, and possibly the only one to date to give credit and recognition to one of the best tactical minds of he Luftwaffe, GFM von Richtofen.While justifiably lambasting the Luftwaffe (and Hitler too) on its short sightedness in forgoing the development of a strategic, heavy bomber in favour of tactical, short range fighters and light payload bombers, Hayward does remind us the indispensable role of the Luftwaffe as the Heer's flying artillery and its role in her battlefield successes.The fact that the Luftwaffe was staffed mainly by transferees from the Heer may be a determining factor in shaping its mission as a tactical, close support airforce, and its reluctance to develop, acqueisce or sustain a naval air arm for the tonnage battle in the Atlantic (same can be said of Raeder's and D&ouml;nitz's strategic shortcomings, both concentrating on their respective favourites, battleships and U-boats, while paying little heed to the crucial role of air cover for naval actions) may stem from the tradtional rivalry during the Kaiser's times between the senior service, Army and the Kaiser's favourite, the Kriegsmarine, which in the Great War proved to be a less than war winning tool, and a dtermining factor (with her mutinies) in the dissolution of the Reich.It is amazing that nobody in the top echelons of the Luftwaffe had articulated a strategic vision for the role of the service in war. Same with the Krigesmarine with its focus and fetish on battleships and U boats.Bearing in mind that Germany was flanked by her traditional enemies in Europe, and the need for the avoidance of the nightmarish 2 front war like the last war, which stretched Germany to her limits as a middling power battling the superpowers (Britain, Russia and USA), the much vaunted General Staff as well as OKW, OKH. OKM. OKL had not seen the need for a strategic airforce of long range fighters and high altitude heavy bombers (plus aircraft carriers for the inevitable last fight with the US after mastery of Europe) that will serve as a deterrent in any enforced peace with Britain and USSR, or as an indisepnsable deep penetrating tool for crippling her enemies' military-political-industrial complexes, the cross-Channel invasion of Britain, the strangling of trans-Atlantic trade between Britian and her Dminions as well as her banker, the US.Inter-service rivalry will see the Luftwaffe refusing to build up a naval air arm, or let the Kriegamrine to have one, nor did the latter, with its uni-dimensional focus on the war at sea, see the need for aircover and aircraft carriers ( all because of the myopic expedient that for the same amount of steel, you can build 20 U boats in a shorter time) for her naval units. This led to the loss of aircover over her bases, and drove the U boats underwater (thus limiting her striking power as they fought on the surface!) and her surface units immobilised in hideouts in France and Norway.Without a strategic airforce, and with the loss of air supremacy at home and above the battelfields, Germany suffred from the vicious cycle of loss of aircover, then devastated industries, then even less aircrafts, arms and munitions to fight off her enemies on all fronts,and so on. In the end, the Luftwaffe was no more than the Heer's last mobile artiller and machine gun battalions (most of the Heer's artillery was horse drawn) and the Kreigsmarine an impotent coast guard.It would be interesting to see if, like the Generalstab, most of the Heer transferees were artillerists ( the most technical proficient branch and thus uniquely suited to the technically most demanding service), who with their mindset would predisposed them to a tactical, close support vision of the Luftwaffe",

      "author": "Andrea Sutcliffe",
      "rate": "2.7/5",
      "description": "In 1807, Robert Fulton, using an English mail-order steam engine, chugged four miles an hour up the Hudson River, passing into popular folklore as the inventor of the steamboat. However, the true first passenger steamboat in America, and the world, was built from scratch, and plied the Delaware River in 1790, almost two decades earlier. Its inventor, John Fitch, never attained Fulton's riches, and was rewarded with ridicule and poverty. Considering there was not a single working steam engine in America in the early 1780s, Fitch's steamboat's development was nothing short of remarkable. But he faced competition from the start, and he and several other inventors fought a string of bitter battles, legal and otherwise. Steam tells the dramatic story of Fitch and his adversaries, weaving their lives into a fascinating tale including the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. It is the story behind America's first important venture in technology, the persevering and colorful men that made it happen, and the great invention that moved a new nation westward.",

His achievements were great, but only because a bunch of inventors went before him. He too stood on the shoulders of giants, he just didn't admit it.Andrea Sutcliffe has done a good job here of pulling together the history of the development of steam powered vessels in the United States.She mentions that Henry Miller Shreve (after whom Shreveport, Louisiana was named) built some steam boats. I tend to say that the thing Robert Fulton built was really a steam ship, that is a deep draft vessel, suitable for use in deep rivers like you find in the Northeast. Shreve invented (along with some help of course) the typical Mississippi River Steamboat.This is probably not important, but when we think of the early boats, we tend to think of riverboats on the Mississippi not the early boats on the Hudson.Recommended book.",

Alas, not only is that answer wrong; but a correct one cannot be summed up by just one name, one year, or one event. Andrea Sutcliffe unravels the tangled web of men, machines, failures, successes, financial backers, patents and politics involved in getting steamships chugging on American rivers during the time period of 1784 to 1811. Here we learn about people like John Fitch and James Rumsey. We discover how George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were involved in the process. We read about boiler explosions, innumerable tinkerings and improvements, and proving \"who had what idea when.\" The newly-formed Patent Office plays a huge role in this drama. Robert Fulton doesn't even make an appearance until the last third of the book. Throughout it all, one has to wonder about the tenacity and sanity of the men who not only had to deal with the temperament of machines, but also with the skepticism of state and federal authorities. Imagine attempting to take a prototype steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers during the New Madrid earthquake of 1811! Why didn't we ever hear about these stories in school? As for Robert Fulton: \"As Fulton freely admitted, he never really invented the steamboat. Rather, he built the first steamboat that really worked.\" (p. 180) And he comes off as a dandy and an opportunist in this book.You might scoff and ask, \"How interesting can the history of the steamboat be?\" Read this book and find out. The miracle is that this invention ever came to fruition.",

Showalter's research is thorough, and her presentation of information shows a care and attentiveness to her material that increases the confidence of the reader. Drawing on a cultural sangria of material, The Female Malady traces the systematic (and often blundering) treatment of mental disease, focusing on how women influenced the establishment as not only patients, but commentators in the form of employees and writers, activists and advocates.The majority of the text focuses on the plight of the Victorian woman, and how doctors and the medical profession responded to what they perceived as the nervous energy attached to the rising discontent of women as a gendered class. However, the text does not end there, and moves on to discuss everything from evolving practices in institutions, the feminization of mental disease, the presence and treatment of male patients, psychoanalysis, and the feminist therapy movement. Showalter skillfully blends historical observation and study with careful literary analysis to give her reader and understanding of the material from several angles and increase their awareness of the historical implications of insanity not just for the evolution of women, but for the sciences and literary fields alike. At just 250 pages, The Female Malady is by no means a complete history, but proves to be a useful volume on its own, especially for those considering cultural and literary implications of insanity beyond the straight-forward studies of psychology or psychoanalytic theory.",

However, you can ignore the old adage of taking what Robert Tallant had to say with a grain of salt; you will need an entire salt lick to handle this slim volume. It is colorful, exciting, and alas, mostly the product of Robert Tallant's fevered imagination. What facts he didn't get wrong, he completely fabricated.Plenty of scholars have already weighed in on the problems presented and alas, also created by this small piece of creative fiction. It's very entertaining, although occasionally offensive. Mostly, it should not be taken seriously.Eoghan Ballard (Ph.D. Folklore. University of Pennsylvania 2005)",

          "comment": "I've done anthropological work on Voodoo practices in New Orleans, both the newer Haitian forms and the traditional religion of the faithful. As pointed out by all the scholarly reviews both back then and today, Tallant has collected an interesting set of folklore narratives about Voodoo but no actual information about the religion as it is practiced. Also, some academics have looked through his notes from his interviews and found that he later added elements to the published versions of stories to make them racier and more exciting. Therefore, folklore scholars should be careful.None of the narratives in Tallant's book match up with historical evidence for how Vodou was practiced in the times of slavery, during the time when he did his fieldwork, or in the modern context. In fact, it is so inaccurate that scholars of Vodou (such as myself) often use this book as a litmus test. If someone cites it as an accurate source of information about Vodou then you know their work is pretty much worthless/that they didn't do any fieldwork.Unfortunately, there is very little written about Vodou practices in New Orleans that is worthwhile. Most of what is out there is sensational speculation. Tallant, unfortunately, falls into that category.",

      "description": "Tormented girls writhing in agony, stern judges meting out harsh verdicts, nineteen bodies swinging on Gallows Hill. The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which climaxed in the Salem witch trials From rich and varied sources—many neglected and unknown—Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum give us a picture of the people and events more intricate and more fascinating than any other in the massive literature. It is a story of powerful and deeply divided families and of a community determined to establish an independent identity—beset by restraints and opposition from without and factional conflicts from within—and a minister whose obsessions helped to bring this volatile mix to the flash point. Not simply a dramatic and isolated event, the Salem outbreak has wider implications for our understanding of developments central to the American experience: the disintegration of Puritanism, the pressures of land and population in New England towns, the problems besetting farmer and householder, the shifting role of the church, and the powerful impact of commercial capitalism.",

          "comment": "Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed - The Social Origins of Witchcraft has long been recognized as one of several standard texts for university level classes on the subject. The authors view Salem as a specific and perhaps hyperbolic extension of the world-wide socio-economic tensions occasioned by the rise of Mercantile Capitalism (209). Specifically, they postulate that the growth of political-religious factionalism within Salem Village was due primarily to causes beyond local control; and that, when combined with the inopportune convergence of certain chance factors (such as long lasting intra-family feuds and the debate over the church) and personalities (such as Parris, Putnam and Porter), resulted in the collective abreaction of social tensions we now know as the Salem Witchcraft Episode (178, 191). Salem Possessed is a logical, extremely readable, and seemingly well researched book. However, a closer examination of both the focus and methodology may be in order.It will be readily admitted that a definition of the term \"social history\" remains ambiguous. There are, however, certain basic expectations a historian expects to have fulfilled by any worked labeled so, among them: explanations concerning the broad socio-political background leading to a specific event; how the effects of this background narrow in focus and relate to the local event; how the event itself impacts various effected segments of society; and how these segments themselves view and/or react to the event. The specific focus chosen by Boyer and Nissenbaum fail to fulfill the great majority of these expectation.It is a specific contention of the authors that the social environment of Salem accurately reflected the contemporary antagonism between larger social, political and economic forces (179-81, 209). However, the excessively narrow focus of the work would belie such an assertion. Little or no mention is made of the impact of the Restoration of the Stuarts and Britain's subsequent political-economic \"Reach for Empire\", or the resultant development of mercantile capitalism and the rise of the merchant group. Such omissions are all the more telling because it is the implicit ideological conflict between capitalist merchants and a declining Puritan oligarchy which provide the framework of local factionalism upon which Boyer and Nissenbaum center their research.In addition, although it is a commonly held belief that the Salem witch trials were - at least in part - an extension of the widespread European witch hunts of 1500-1700, no mention of these precedent setting events is made. In fact, little attention is paid to contemporary perceptions of witchcraft whether European or Colonial.A third and perhaps even more directly applicable topic passed over by the authors is the role of gender. Why, for example, are most of the postulated causes primarily, if not exclusively, male concerns, such as the payment of taxes, control of the village council, and service in the Salem Town Watch? This is especially confusing when one considers that a great majority of both afflicted and accused were female. From a broader perspective, the authors totally disregard the possible social (not to mention misognistic) complications arising from a patriarchal society which singles out and condemns a sizable percentage of their own womenfolk. These lapses alone serve to relegate the book to the less ambitious ranks of a local - rather than a truly \"social\" - history.A second and equally grievous criticism concerns the authors' selective but obviously calculated use of post ipso facto psychological methods to compensate when - and wherever purely historical methods appear insufficient. Rather than admitting that perhaps we just don't know exactly why people act and react they way they do, Boyer and Nissenbaum attempt convoluted psychoanalytical explanations which the objective observer must label conjecture, at best. The inappropriate nature of such techniques when applied at a chronological distance of over 280 years becomes especially obvious in Chapter 7 where the psychological portrait provided describes Pastor Samuel Parris as an insecure (169) paranoid (170) and self-hating (177) obsessive-compulsive (167) megalomaniac who compares himself to Christ (169), yet such a characterization directly contradicts the later portrait of Parris as the \"representative [i.e., typical] man of his time\".It also seems that Salem Possessed exhibits at least one consistently identifiable bias, that being the authors' rather obvious disparaging treatment of capitalism. Far from being the harbinger of modernity which supplanted an oppressive and antiquated Puritan world-view, capitalism is characterized as \"the lure which menaced the village\" (101), \"a looming moral threat\" (105), a \"violation of much that is contained in the word 'Puritan'\" (106), and as responsible for \"many disputes and difficulties\" (102). Even acquiescing the fact that total objectivity is impossible, one would assume Boyer and Nissenbaum could have at least done a better job of camouflaging their own 1960's liberal academic backgrounds.Finally, for a work in which a large portion of the text deals with such verifiable data as demographics and family relationships, Boyer and Nissenbaum seem to depend rather excessively upon secondary sources. For example, of the fifty-seven total references cited in the first ten pages of the book, only seventeen were original records. This imbalance becomes all the more glaring when one takes into account the authors' own statements concerning the comparatively large amount of primary documentation available on the subject (x - xi).In sum, it must be admitted that Salem Possessed does have its merits. It is well written with an easy to follow style. The extensive research and clarity of expression evidenced in sections dealing specifically with local factionalism are impressive. And Boyer and Nissenbaum's ability to translate complex relationships into readable prose is entertaining, if not always one hundred percent accurate. Unfortunately, the authors not only utilize inappropriate and unsubstantiated psychological interpretations to support their primary socio-historic focus, but they fail to place this focus within a larger world-historical framework. In fact, they seem to leave out almost as much as they cover, a trait that considerably lowers the overall quality and usefulness of the work.",

But that does not mean this is not a very valuable book for those who study this subject. Since it does end with a socio-economic explanation of events, it marshalls and displays an impressive amount of evidence regarding the state of Salem Village at the time of the outbreak. You are unlikely to find this information elsewhere, and it is just as likely to support an alternative explanation as the one to which the authors lead you.For example, early in the book, the authors make the connection between the events in Salem and the events, 42 years later, a few dozen miles to the west, in Northampton, Massachusetts, during what was called the First or \"Little\" Great Awakening in the parish of Jonathan Edwards. This was the source for my alternate theory of the events in Salem. This means that one should read this book with an open heart, get what ideas are good, and criticize the ideas which may be too much of a stretch.If the authors attend too much to any one point, it seems to be the motives of certain individuals. My reading of the events is that it was an incident fuelled not by the evil or ignorance of one person, like Thomas de' Torquemada's role in the Spanish Inquisition, but in the sense of the times, fed by the way in which the incident was sparked by the Amerindian slave Tituba and her vision of many witches signing the Devil's book.",

          "comment": "\"Salem Possessed\" is a well researched but ultimately flawed account of the Witch trials of 1692. Boyer's and Nissenbaum's main contention is that the trials were a result of the animosity borne by the increasing bifurcation between Salem Village and Salem Town.Specifically, as the Porter family in Salem gained in wealth, land and political influence, the Putnams (the main accusers in 1692) were hemmed in. The main nexus of envy, the authors argue, lay in the second marriage of Thomas Putnam to one Mary Veren. It was ultimately Mary Veren in 1695 that willed a vast majority of her estate to the Porters. One would think then that the main accusations of witchcraft would be leveled against the Porters or those closest to them. Instead, the main accusations were made against people geographically close to the Porters in the eastern part of the village. The authors attempt to explain away this incongruity by reading into the documents and supplanting hard evidence with imagined psychological motivations. For instance, the authors argue that the Putnam's rage was directed towards outsiders rather then Mary Putnam (Veren). This begs the question: Why were the accusations not leveled against the Porters and/or Mary Veren herself? The authors argue that the Putnams would not dare touch the Porters because of their high status, but why not when the stakes were so high as the authors have argued time and time again? This cannot be explained by simply a matter of `social deference.' That, in my opinion, is the ultimate failure of the book. If the witch trials were primarily an organized campaign against encroaching land-grabbing and commercialism, as the authors would have us believe, why accuse social outcasts? Although this book may suffice at the undergraduate level, at a higher level of academia it cannot stand up to very tough scrutiny. At the end of the day, it raises far to many questions then it does answers.",

Interestingly, war photography during this period does not include many phtographs of actual combat, particularly close combat. Photography still being in its relative infancy and the perilous nature of raising ones head above a trench, probably account for this. The reader is presented with hundreds of photographs which serve to give a sense of what it was like for the soldiers during World War One. There are very few diagrams in this book.

If these sentinels could talk, imagine the tales they would tell of ferocious Great Lakes storms taking their toll on vessels and people alike.

It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation.",

It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.",

          "comment": "The new baseball season will soon be upon us, with hope breaking out all over. Those of us who are Chicago White Sox fan see our team starting off even with every other time and hope abounding. What will the season hold? Only 162 games will tell us.This book is one of those compendia that come out each year, providing information on major league baseball players. This has a sabermetric element to it, so those who love statistics will enjoy this work.There are some nice features, including a listing of the top 100 prospects this season, how base running turns into runs, projected leaders in a variety of categories (e.g., they project Ryan Howard to lead in home runs with 44, Albert Pujols to lead in batting average with .327, Jose Reyes to lead in stolen bases with 60, etc.).Those projections are based on a technique called PECOTA, in which players are equated with many other players--past and present--with similar characteristics. Then, that data base is used to project how well the particular contemporary player is likely to do this year. As an example, let's take a look at one team, the White Sox. Many of the Sox' key players are aging, and projections suggest declining performance among such stalwarts as Jim Thome and A. J. Pierzynski. Paul Konerko and Jermaine Dye, on the other hand, are projected to perform in similar fashion to 2007. By the way, one of the nice features is that each player is compared to those whose career statistics define PECOTA. For instance, comparables to Joe Crede include Dave Roberts, Kevin Orie, Tim Wallach, and Tim Hulett. Just looking at comparables is fun! Jermaine Dye is equated with Dave Henderson, Joe Adcock, Jose Canseco, and Juan Gonzalez. Pretty good company (at least for statistics). Paul Konerko is compared with Kevin Millar, Gil Hodges, Jeff Conine, and Eric Karros. The mainstay of the pitching staff, Mark Buehrle, is linked to Ken Holtzman (the old Cubbie!), Greg Swindell, Jim Abbott, and Curt Simmons.Enough comparisons. Another statistic is called VORP, value over replacement player. This statistic is created by assuming that a particular player would be removed from the lineup and replaced by someone of proven quality (the details are too lengthy to be presented in a line or two). The resulting figures are then used to estimate players who will rise and who will decline this coming year. White Sox fans might want to shiver a bit. Mark Buehrle is one of the projected 15 players who will decline the most.A couple other figures to illustrate what the book provides. Jim Thome is expected to see his home run total decline from 35 to 29 and his RBIs from 96 to 79. If you're curious, by the way, his comparator players include Frank Thomas, Willie McCovey, Darrell Evans, and Cliff Johnson--some pretty good company!Anyhow, this is a book that will be a lot of fun for baseball fans. It's a good way to start preparing for the new baseball season!",

These guys are not always on the nose -- their obsession with positions is a bit limiting to my mind, for one thing -- but they're right a helluva lot more often than they're wrong, and they've already proven themselves prophetic in many instances (for example, the White Sox's migrating back to the middle of the pack and the Mets' collapse). Plus, they're good writers -- not only are their analyses far more cogent than most sportswriters (admittedly, not a difficult task, since most sportswriters, not to mention analysts, can't tell their rear ends from their elbows), but those analyses are great fun to read for aesthetic reasons.Anybody who really cares about the game will love this book.",

      "description": "From the author of The Long Season—considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time—comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant. With legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan’s first book, The Long Season, he not only entered the canon of great sports literature, but also redefined it when he returned two years later to write Pennant Race—his memoir of his days playing for the Cincinnati Reds and how the team went from not being taken seriously as a pennant contender to having a shot at the 1961 National League pennant. In Pennant Race, Brosnan—with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality—once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish—if cautious—optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. Pennant Race vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball’s most memorable eras. “Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.”—New Yorker",

Although if the NLers had paid attention to what was going on in the American League in 1961 they would have had a pretty good clue.That year in the AL, like most years then, the Yankees steamrolled their way to yet another AL Championship but this time with a historic home run race between Mantle and Maris as well as prodigious hitting by many of the other junior circuit clubs. But in 1961 the Al expanded to ten teams which meantat least two pitching staffs that were just a little below big league skilllevels. Which certainly must have helped all those sluggers hit those dingers.Meanwhile, back in the old fashioned NL, the Reds defeated last years World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates for the NL pennant and a shot at the powerful Yankees in the World Series. You can read all about it in Brosnan's 1961diary except for the World Series which was not included in in Pennant Race possibly because Mr.Brosnan wanted to end the book on a triumphant note. BTW, the Yankees won four out of five games against the Reds in the 1961 World Series.Pennant Race is perhaps the most entertaining sports book that I have ever read, there are several laugh out loud sections and it is extrememly interesting to hear Brosanan's on field contemporaries' reactions to his first book, The Long Season. Pennant Race, despite the fact that the 1961 World Series is not covered, is without a doubt one of the finest, pioneering sports books of our time.",

          "comment": "I Like this book. I think that is great for introduction to Jujitsu as well as a supplementing reference to jujitsu for one who is already practicing the martial art. The techniques covered in the book do work for appropriate situations. While no martial art is so complete as to deal with every conflict situation in which one may find oneself, Small Circle Jujitsu offers a good range of techniques to deal with many common assault scenarios. Small Circle Jujitsu Offers the defender the potential advantage of achieving control over an attacker with minimum effort and an option of not causing injury to attacker once he has been subdued. Karate, Kung Fu, and Boxing do not have these optional advantages.All the technigues are labled, described and explained in english as opposed to many other books which label techniques in Japanese. I think that this serves well the beginning student of Jujitsu who may know nothing of Japanese language or culture; but may still want to learn an efficient means of self defense. I suspect that the use of Japanese terminology in an English culture might even intimidate many prospective Jujitsu students from ever taking up the martial art simply because they cannot even pronounce the words.The book itself is divided into 5 chapters. Beginning students should pay attention to the rules of safety included towards the front of the book. This is because some of the techniques can cause serious injury.Topics covered in the book include falls, exercises, resuscitation, weak points of the body, wrist locks, finger locks, arm bars, arm locks, leg locks, throwing techniques, chokes, as well as defenses against strikes, chokes, body grabs, wrist grabs.The explanations and pictures of techniques are easy to follow and understand.I think one of the things that make this book such a good value is because the reader also has the option of buying a series of videos and DVD's by the same title and author which show the student the motion and application of smooth, continous transition of techniques which cannot be captured by still pictures and explanatory text. The DVD's can be played back in slow motion which is a learning advantage in any sport. The VHS videos and DVD's can be bought from Amazon.com or direct from Black Belt Magazine at WWW.Blackbeltmag.com.Videos and DVD's can be bought separately or as a complete set. Black Belt Magazine sometimes offers the whole set of 5 VHS tapes or DVD's at the price of 4 tapes or DVD's. Look for the offer if interested.I give this book and the videos 5 each stars because it is evident that Professor Wally Jay really invested much time and effort into making sure that students will be able to understand and make use of the contents of the book and videos of Small Circle Jujitsu as a means of an efficient and effective means of self defence.Small-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 1 - FoundationsSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 3 - Grappling TechniquesSmall-Circle Jujitsu, Vol 4 - Tendon, Tricep, Armbars and ArmlocksNihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 1Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 2Nihon Jujitsu by Norm Belsterling Volume 5Foot Throws: Karate, Judo and Self-DefenseChin Na In Depth - Courses 1 - 4 (YMAA grappling)Chin Na In Depth - Courses 5 - 8Chin Na In Depth - Courses 9 - 12",

Give me the joint cranks, and let me work on those. Write another book filled with Philosophy, etc., . I assure you, I will buy that one too. Don't mix the focus.As well, for people my age, there is a need for reading glasses. But reading glasses, and falling in the dojo don't go well together. So, I think that a larger book would be appropriate, e.g. 8.5\" x 11\". But, there are DVDs apparently. Maybe that would be better for me.As for the remaining 75%, they were filled with techniques. Unlike some other reviewers, I WANTED to see more and more techniques. They were not problematic to follow, rather easy actually. There were several panels with exceptionally close photography for some techniques, and I would judge them as being required.I was very pleased with this purchase.

      "title": "The Pro: Lessons from My Father About Golf and Life",
      "author": "Butch Harmon",
      "rate": "3.0/5",
      "description": "Butch Harmon is the world’s number one golf coach. He taught Tiger Woods through one of the greatest stretches of victories in golf history (and, perhaps even more conspicuously, did not teach Tiger Woods following his unprecedented run), as well as superstars like Greg Norman, Adam Scott, Fred Couples, Darren Clarke, Natalie Gulbis, and Davis Love III. How did he become such a legendary teacher and mentor? The answer is simple: He learned from watching his father. The Harmons are the First Family of golf, and Claude Harmon, Sr., was the greatest of them all. His skill as a player, an innovator, a teacher, a devoted father, a loyal friend, and a peer of giants such as Ben Hogan has gone largely unappreciated by all but those who knew him best. In this book by his son, he finally gets his due. In The Pro, Butch Harmon paints a compelling portrait of an era in sports before the emergence of big media and bigger money, and shows how the lessons he learned about life and golf at his father’s knee made him the man he is today. The Pro is both a family and a golf memoir, as well as an inside look at what it takes to teach the Tigers of the world. It describes how Butch and his brothers, who are also teachers, transfer their father’s unique wit, wisdom, and philosophy to the next generation of golfers. Sometimes their advice relates to the game, sometimes they simply offer words of encouragement and motivation, sometimes they make pointed criticisms intended to shock their students into focus, and sometimes they try to impart simple advice about “walking around through life.” The Harmon brothers are teachers who share a special quality: All of their lessons are passed down from their father. Millions of golf fans know Butch Harmon; many are even familiar with his father and brothers. But never before have we been given such an intimate look at life among the legends of golf. The Pro is the story of an extraordinary father and son that will resonate with anyone who has ever looked back on life and recognized the wisdom of their parents’ teachings. \"Golf's hard,\" Dad would say, pointing a meaty finger at me as if he were about to reveal the secret of the Rosetta Stone. “Good golf is damn hard, and championship golf is something only a few will ever see. But that’s how it should be. If it were easy, everybody would do it. And where’s the fun in that?” From Butch Harmon, the world’s number one golf coach, comes the inside story of how he learned everything he knows about golf and life from his father, Claude Harmon, Sr. Both a family memoir and a reminiscence of growing up among the legends of sport, The Pro is a portrait of one extraordinary family and the game that will carry their legacy for years to come.",

          "comment": "If you follow golf you know the name of Claude \" Butch\" Harmon. He's a household name. But, little did I know about his father's influence on all his children and friends.Isn't it refreshing to see in the age of prima donnas and in the me, me, me world that we get a story about a man who had values of being grounded, down to earth, caring and most importantly, giving. The chapter on \"Don't Ever Mix Your Ego With Ignorance is classic revelation.This is an exceptional book about the life of Butch Harmon's father, Claude Harmon and his wit and wisdom on life. I was really touched by this reading. After reading the first chapter you won't be able to put it down and after you finish it you'll be telling yourself what a insightful and profound man this Claude Harmon was.I think the most interesting writing Harmon Jr. shares with us is Claude's unconditional love, respect, honor, and passion of goodness to other people. This book reads as a tribute to a great man who did his best for his six children and was always there for them. What I loved about reading this was how open and candid Harmon writes about his father...the prose and memory of what his father said to him as a young child is endearing. The words and claritity Butch writes about feel real and jump off the page into your pysche. it's as if you really wanted to meet this man, his father, and get to know him.Interesting to note is Claude Sr's relationship with the legendary Ben Hogan. Hogan and Harmon had a friendship that was very close and unique. You couldn't find two more diverse personalities, but Butch Harmon sheds light on Hogan's caring and sensitive side. A side that never was written about or told.When Hogan visited the ailing Harmon and told him, \"Claude, I just want to tell you that you were one of the best friends I ever had\" it's a very poignant moment. And when Hogan heard word from Butch that Claude passed away he cries...these are events we would never expect Hogan to do or say.If you are a golf fan or not, please take time out to read this. You will not only get Claude Sr's unique life lessons or \"pearls\" as Butch Harmon calls them, but you will get a brutally honest look inside Claude Harmon Sr. and Butch Harmon.I'm a golfer...err golf nut...and have been playing for over 24 years. If I ever had the great honor and privilege to ever take a lesson from the 'great' Butch Harmon I would have the feeling, realization, and awareness that not only Butch would be looking at my swing, but his special and unforgettable father as well. That's a testament to the knowledge that Butch gained over the years being with his father and absorbing priceless teaching skills to golfers of any level.Thanks \"Butch\" for a great book.",

The truth is I have the rest of my lifetime to learn and this book is a tremendous resource to that end.It does read like novel, and gives great explanation and rationale for why to use certain equipment for certain conditions and species of fish.

It focuses on one particular branch of Gypsies and the clan warfare that made their clan the ascendant one and its leader, Tene Bimbo, the self-proclaimed King of the Gypsies.The author presents an unvarnished look at Gypsies. He notes their insularity and clannishness, their lives lived on the fringes of mainstream society, and the classic cons by which they survive. Scorning education, nine-to-five jobs, and anyone outside of their cultural milieu, they are a fascinating group of people with their own complex rules and regulations by which they live.The book also relates an ongoing and violent family feud, between Tene Bimbo's son, Carranza, and his grandson, Steve, Carranza's son. It is a feud that was exacerbated when King Tene Bimbo died and left his legacy to Steve, bypassing Carranza. What was more surprising was that Steve had rejected the traditional Gypsy lifestyle and was trying to lead a more mainstream life, urging others to do the same.This is a well written, well researched book that provides a fascinating glimpse of a group of people and a lifestyle about which little is known. Gypsies definitely live lives that are outside the parameters of accepted norms of behavior. Those who have an interest in other cultures, as well as those with an interest in the true crime genre, will certainly enjoy this book, which has six pages of black and white photographs.",

Addressing all the various occult(semantic definition of &quot;hidden &amp; rejected knowledge&quot;) routes via the shortcut of this Art Historian's scholarly mind, as a whole this work is one of the best and most easily approachable &quot;magic histories&quot; for those who have no previous knowledge concerning occultism except an undeniable interest and fascination with the mysterious and the spiritual.Kurt Seligmann is darkly fascinated and explores endlessly the multitude of historic beliefs concerning the study of the nature of evil... such as black magic, necromancy, Elizabethian era conjurers and their Enochian magic,primitive rites, evocations of the Cultus Satanus, Goetia Demonomania, et.al....as an example, early on he discusses Chaldean phliosophies in which: &quot;Evil was born from God's disturbing thoughts&quot;...I have long wondered if the proposed thoughts had to do specifically with humanity?...and this book will surely set the fire or fan the sulphurous flames of those burning to know more about all things occult.The book primarily deals with Western Esoteric Traditions, which, being a westerner, appeals to my insatiable explorative appetite in studying and discovering the divinity of humankind and the accorded propensity &amp; potentials of individual spiritual progress through Magick and the strengthening of divine will ; in comparison with more Eastern idealogies concerned with mystical enlightenment and the abolishing of the ego to attain Nirvana.In summation, Kurt Seligmann, as one of the last efforts of his exemplary artistic journey throughout the early 20th century avant-garde, has given the world a completely unbiased in-depth world history from a magical perspective, a genuine labor of love which will always retain its intimately artistic personality in contrast to the strict scholarly treatise of the newspaper skeptic variety; and although there are better, more developed and intrigueing accounts out there, none are at the moment so readily available and economic, nor so expressive, or conclusively compact as this. Finally, the book has over a hundred and fifty illustrations from alchemical treatise and magical grimoires which compliment his descriptive writing style.It is besides all this, another exclamation point punctuating the Surrealist movement. surrealyours, an occultist.",

Dan's wife, Susan, is whiny and sometimes I wanted to slap her; the daughter is a typical little brat, and what Uncle Kyle wants to do to her is pretty sick.

The different methods this book used to capture the essence of Spirit were brilliant. Those would be: Sufism, Dreamwork, and Jungian Psychology. He writes about those archetypal characters that are within your own self, and the dark shadows that you have by which casted a veil between you and the Beloved. That is what is also key to this work, it describes the true Love that is God and that I know is the essence of our full existence and the Ultimate Reality. It is the ocean that is God, and any love that we experience in this life is a glimpse of the ocean of love which is Oneness. And any beauty here on Earth is a reflection of the infinite ocean of beauty that is Oneness. Our goal is to reach that by transforming our inner shadows. Now you might wonder how that archetypal plane is related to reaching Oneness, and that is through the other side of this book: dreamwork. Usually in describing monism and reaching God through the higher levels of reality, dreams are thought of as lower levels than what we experience now. But this author interprets them in light of our Self, which is One with realization of God. I must say that while reading this I felt more deeply suspended into that mystic Oneness.",

      "description": "'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.",

          "comment": "The world still awaits a truly comprehensive history of Neopaganism. Margo Adler's estimable DRAWING DOWN THE MOON is perhaps the closest approach to date. With THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON, British historian Ronald Hutton has raised the bar for future efforts both in terms of depth of research and genuine insight. Though his book focuses on the antecedents and development of British Wicca, it contains a wealth of material to any reader interested in Neopaganism.Hutton is something of a bte noire for many Wiccans and other Neopagans after his iconoclastic PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES, particularly for his corrosive attacks on Robert Graves and THE WHITE GODDESS (however deserved they may have been). Hutton's work is, nevertheless, grounded in substantial research (as befits a widely-published historian) and a generally non-judgmental tone. Hutton continues his no-stone-unturned approach in this new book, but departs from simple history to offer rationales for the viability of Neopaganism as a religious path, even given its apparent twentieth-century origins.For many Neopagans outside of traditionalist Wicca, the book's focus on Neopagan Witchcraft (and in particular on Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders) may render its iconoclasm old news. Hutton's research only buttresses the deconstruction of Wicca begun in the '70s. Hutton's gift, though, is to go beyond the first order deconstruction and find unexpected bits of information amidst an impressive array of personal papers and museum holdings. For example, most informed readers will already be aware that &quot;Old&quot; Dorothy Clutterbuck, Gardner's supposed initiatrix, was shown to be a real person, after years of argument to the contrary. Hutton demonstrates, however--and rather conclusively to my mind--that &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; could not have been the person who initiated Gardner and he points emphatically to another woman who may have been hiding behind a smokescreen of Gardner's creation. Similarly, Hutton is not afraid to take on the now-taken-for-granted notion advanced by Aidan Kelly that the ritual nudity and scourging involved in Gardnerian Wicca were simply manifestations of Gardner's personal sexual kinks. Hutton ransacks Gardner's personal collection of pornography to refute this--and offers suggestions as to the real roots of these practices.The book is of greatest interest to the general (read, &quot;non-Wiccan&quot;) Neopagan reader in two regards. First, Hutton clearly demonstrates that the cultural roots of the Pagan revival lie embedded in the Romantic movement, particularly in Romantic Era poetry. The real forebears of the movement are seen to be, not Leland or Crowley (though both are examined and acknowledged), but poets like Keats, Shelley and Swinburne, who first identified the feminine divine with Nature and who repopularized the use of classical Pagan deities like Diana and Pan, often against critical resistance. The way in which Hutton tracks the passage of these motifs from literature into religion is fascinating.Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON represents a scholarly book by an apparently non-Pagan historian (unlike Adler) who is willing to see past the herd of sacred cows he is slaughtering to point out the transcendent values of Neopaganism--Wiccan or otherwise. He is careful throughout the book never to reach categorical judgements against some deeply-held beliefs, even where the evidence might strongly point in that direction. And, in the final pages of the book, Hutton sets aside the persona of the dispassionate researcher to advocate for pagan witchcraft as &quot;a full-blown, independent religion,&quot; one &quot;which deliberately draws upon ancient images and ideas for comtemporary needs,&quot; a protean faith which &quot;takes ideas from many sources and applies them in many--and often constantly altering--ways.&quot; Hutton hinted at this favorable sentiment in PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES and it is to his credit that he is willing to expand upon it here.Even speaking as an initiate in one of the traditions critically examined in the book (&quot;1734&quot; Witchcraft), I recommend it highly.",

      "description": "This true account of the aliens who invaded the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia - first published in 1975 - has been made into a major motion picture starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney and Alan Bates. For thirteen months Point Pleasant was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic 'Bird' - the Mothman. The story reads like a novel - but every single word of it is true and fully documented by John A. Keel, who spent a year in Point Pleasant where he saw and experienced many of the stranger manifestations personally.",

          "comment": "There are studied subjects and phenomenon out there that defy scientific explanation. Just because one cannot put a particular phenomenon under the rigours of scientific examination, doesn't mean such phenomenon is merely the product of a deranged mind. The reason the protectors of divine rationality are reluctant to examine the paranormal is it seems to contradict known physical laws. It doesn't follow the rules. However, if you have actually had the fortune or misfortune to experience such phenomenon i.e., spirits, UFO's, demonic creatures or source less cries of anguish in the night, ~The Mothman Prophecies~ can seem almost plausible. The book is certainly entertaining and, surprisingly, at times quite frightening.The book essentially focuses on a series of unexplained events that manifested in and around the little West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Numerous reports of Unidentified Flying Objects and strange lights in the southern skies motivated John Keel to investigate what all the fuss was about, and if there was any truth to the reports. His investigations led him down a peculiar path of events and personal experiences that finally pushed him to develop a theory, albeit an extrardinary one.What is the 'Mothman'? A journalist coined the term from the popular Batman series, because the actual creature, taken from eyewitness accounts, resembles the legendary comic hero. The amount of actual sightings is nothing less than incredible, which leads one to suspect the beast's reality. The book only touches on the Mothman and relates a scattered assortment of weird events and unusual sightings from the 'Men in Black' to 'abductions' and the cries of infants in the night. Throughout the book, Keel attempts to connect the dots, so to speak, inferring that all the varied phenomenon could well come from a single source. This is a big reach, but so is the book as a whole.Keel proposes that these manifestations, UFO's, MIB, winged-beasts et al, possibly originate from an alternate reality - another dimension if you will. These other dimensional being(s) guide and play with the human race and have been for a very long time. Throughout history these beings have manifested in many guises and forms, according to a specific historical/social context, depending on civilizations particular belief system at the time. For example, in the middle ages, this other dimensional phenomenon showed in the form of witches, warlocks, fairies and elves. For the American Indian, the phenomenon appeared as nature spirits; and in ancient times, they manifested as winged-lions, centaurs and Olympic gods. Because of our technological advancements and predilection to anything 'scientific', they now show as flying saucers, aliens and FBI agents. In other words, Keel suggests that their form shows in the way we 'interpret' these sightings - screened through our socially conditioned minds.Generally these amazing stories are told in a matter of fact tone, a journalistic style, setting the reader up from the start to lend credence to the entire book. This is clever and it works. But one gets the impression that Keel is absolutely serious about his subject matter - and to this day is trying to get to the bottom of it. This is what makes the book intriguing and worth the time.",

I disagree with some of Keel's conclusions, at least with respect to them being the final word in what is obviously an ongoing puzzle, but he points to some very interesting possibilities. His notions are well worth adding to the soup of the still bubbling mystery that such bizarre experiences as Mothman, MIBs, strange aerial lights, odd electrical and poltergeist effects, etc., represent.That much if not all of what is reported is Earth-related does not lessen the difficulty of asserting categorically that &quot;extradimensional&quot; beings are entirely localized. The possibility of worlds without end lie that way, whether connected by wormholes or whatever in this dimension or in other layers outside of this one. I'd bet John a bottle of HERRADURA SELECCION SUPREMA tequila that our multilayered universe is full of life in many forms, mostly unexpected, and that this will become obvious far sooner than later (in the next hundred years at least).-- Randy",

I would gladly send you, dear reader, this book for free, saving you the cost of purchase, but the shipping fee is too great a cost, considering that I may use the book for fuel for a fire to warm me on a cold winters night...It reminds me of the great words of Eric Cartman: &quot;Well, they took me up in their spaceship, and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye&quot;.

It's a story of one man's journey from skeptic to the other side....by the end of the book, Keel is not necessarily a stone believer, but he is a stone paranoid, which amounts to the same thing. He goes into the book carrying one belief system and walks out of it with quite another.This, I feel, is the actual appeal of the book. We get to witness not the transformation of a character, but the transformation of the author, which makes this not only a fascinating study, but a dangerous book indeed.And why is it dangerous? Because a researcher changed his mind? No, it is dangerous because the researcher had CREDENTIALS beforehand...he's a scholar. If Gore Vidal (the historian) told you that in his research for \"Lincoln\" he discovered that Lincoln liked to savage rabbits with his bare hands...would you believe me?Of course not...but the problem here is that there is no historical record to go on, that if we are to believe, we believe on the basis of our judgment of a man's character.That said, I believe he is telling the truth. I have read not only the book in question, but many other works by Keel, and I believe him to be sane. Naive, yes, often. But always he thinks about his topic. This educated man experienced something back in 1967. The question is : should we accept his account of events?I personally say yes, but that is an answer rising from years of \"ufo's exist...\" upbringing, along with my religious convictions.I leave it up to you.The point is, this is a book that needs to be taken not with a grain of salt, but with a full salt lick in front of you. The facts presented are merely things to be looked at more carefully. Here's hoping you do just that. Highly recommended.",

A recap of events that took place in West Virginia during a thirteen month time period in 1966 and 1967. Some of the topics covered are strange creatures, UFO's, men-in-black, and prophetic events.If you are interested in these topics then be prepared to enjoy a few evenings reading some detailed accounts of what happened to some small-town folks who were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been in the right place at the right time. In most instances the author gives a good description of what happened, where it happened, and to whom. These are details that are often omitted in stories of the same type. There are also some good accounts of men-in-black that go beyond the characters in the movie of the same name. You'll want to read the accounts of this aspect of UFO lore.If you are a UFO buff, Ufologist, or self-styled field investigator, then be prepared to be insulted. The author makes no bones about giving little credence or respect to these types of people. Presumably he and a handful of others of the same ilk are the only credible authors. A dichotomy since these are the most likely kind of people to read his book.My only disappointment in the book is that there is not enough cohesiveness to the information.

Though, after the 100th page or so (I don't know what it is about the 100th page for me), the book gets really interesting. Things start happening personally to John Keel himself. It seems as though, the more he begins to find out, and the deeper he goes into things, the more things begin to get in his way and stop him. It becomes apparent that someone or something doesn't want him to know what he knows.. Yet he persists. A very good book which lives up to its name.",

Unfortunately, I found the book somewhat disappointing.The premise of Mothman Prophecies is interesting but the actual execution of the book doesn't live up to the promise of the subject matter. Keel tries to include too much information and too many diverse happenings. While everything in the book contributes to the premise - that strange things did indeed happen in West Virginia one year in the mid-sixties - he never really focuses on any one aspect. Mothmen are one of many phenomena he describes. And while he gives a great deal of background on the many phenomena, he never really lets us know what he thought caused the upheaval that year. There are many case studies but very few conclusions as to the cases he encounters first-hand. And when he does cite previous studies or encounters, his sources seem a little shaky. Citing established sources is one thing but citing what I would think of as fringe publications causes me to question the validity of both his conclusions and the original source material. I do, however, understand that legitimate, well done research is produced by less established organizations and publications.While there are flaws, Keel does make the book enjoyable. It could be dry and lifeless but he injects a good sense of humor into his study keeping the reader engaged. And while you may believe nothing about what he claims happened, he does make a strong case for himself. Its hard to avoid admitting that something outside our collective realms of experience happened that year.",

Keel is an honest investigator who was fortunate to be involved in the strange, spooky events he writes about. Taken along with his first book, Operation Trojan Horse, this slim volume says more about the true nature of the UFO phenomenon than almost any other book written since. I was initially doubtful of the validity of Keel's claims, as some other reviewers are. However, I had the luck of meeting a man mentioned in the book who accompanied Keel on his investigations. This person, whom I trust and sincerely believe to be honest, flatly stated that everything in the book was true, that he had been there, spoke to the witnesses, and eventually became involved in the phenomena, as did Keel. The fact is, these things happened. In fact, Keel left some of the strangest evidence out of the book. Mothman Prophecies is a fascinating true story, and I recommend it to anyone who has a real desire to know the truth about UFOs and the paranormal.",

Because the Mothman case he worked on was not an isolated &quot;monster&quot; invasion but an outbreak of various strange phenomena that had at its center recorded sightings of an unidentified winged creature dubbed the &quot;mothman.&quot; These sightings were part of a larger picture. Keel tells a complicated tale that requires some intelligence and imagination to understand. Without his various sidetrips there is no connection with the bridge collapse and hence no story or drama other than the individual encounters with the apparition. The movie was good but it dramatized the actual events for the sake of making a more cohesive story, just as all other movies based on books do. Take any book based on historical events and make a fiction film out of it and you'll find that certain distoritions must occur. You can't go back and blame history just because it isn't as thrilling and manipulated as fiction.",

Sensational new information about a group of ancient philosophers who were so intensely practical that, two and a half thousand years ago, they shaped our existence and the world we live in ... These are just two ingredients of this extraordinary book, which uncovers an astonishing reality right at the origins of the Western world. Written by one of the most highly-acclaimed contemporary historians and experts in the field, it provides dramatic new evidence about the most important of ancient philosophers, Parmenides—and revolutionizes our understanding of the history of religion, of the origins of philosophy, and of Western culture as a whole.\"--",

The fact is that what burns Mr. Kingsley is the easiness with which he states things. But that is not a new thing to meet with some authors. I would expect more responsible statements, on a firm basis, and not so lighthearted: ''...people at Athens invented the fiction of a united Greece'' or ''Many greek centers of culture preferred to side with the Persians rather with the Athenians. They considered them more civilized.'' p. 222. Well..., not from a professor of Simon Fraser University ! If you read Isokrates' &quot;Panegyrikos&quot; (Thucydides, et.al., also) you will know more than that. Some Greeks really partied the Persians, but the issue was quite political and definitely not cultural (By the way, have you read Chrestos Lazos' books on ancient Greek technology?). As for the domination of the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, cf. Marsilio Ficcino and the Scholastics' interpretation of them as responsible to that. Anyway, the book is nice to read for it presents some (well, not so) unknown aspects of the Underworld ''drwmena'' in the ancient Greek world. If the author payed more attention to the Orphics and to the soothsaying in Homerus' epics, it would be better. Read it, but beware.",

Gnosis is essentially an understanding of the &quot;true&quot; words of Jesus and the application of His way in your personal life. In Genesis, Adam and Eve are prevented by God from consuming fruit from the tree of life. Gnosis of and through Jesus represents a spiritual consumption of that fruit! Also, Gnostics in general were nondiscriminatory in regards to women, and many were early church leaders. This is an excellent book!",

Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting. If you are a fan of the Avon True Romance series, or like historical romances for teens, this book is a must-read.",

Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).",

I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend.",

They had to go through lots of trouble to get there! The British had tons of weapons, so they were ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Read this book to see if the American soldiers survive the long trip to Ticonderoga.In Guns For General Washington the book takes place in 1775(in Boston). It's very cold outside and it is old in Ticonderoga. Paul Revere is 15 years old. Paul's parents move, but Paul decides to stay and keep the house protected.I give this book a five star ratting because it is very cool and it has lots of description! I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to know about wars and likes action!",

      "description": "The classic children's story about a young boy, his toy castle, and a magical adventure that reveals the true meaning of courage When his beloved caretaker Mrs. Phillips tells him she's leaving, William is devastated. Not even her farewell gift of a model medieval castle helps him feel better—though he has to admit it's fascinating. From the working drawbridge and portcullis to the fully-furnished rooms, it's perfect in every detail. It almost seems magical. And when William looks at the silver knight, the tiny figure comes to life in his hand—and tells him a tale of a wicked sorcerer, a vicious dragon, and a kingdom in need of a hero. Hoping the castle's magic will help him find a way to make his friend stay, William embarks on a daring quest with Sir Simon, the Silver Knight—but he will have to face his own doubts and regrets if he's going to succeed. William's story continues in The Battle for the Castle, available as a redesigned companion edition.

This is a true fantasy action book.The book starts out with William Lawrence age 10 who loves to do gymnastics. His Nanny, Mrs. Phillips, feels that it is time to return to her home in England. William does not want her to go and is trying to figure out a way to keep her with him. As part of her goodbye gift to him and a birthday gift, she gives him a castle that is very realistic but miniature. She hands him a small Silver Knight to use in the castle. William feels the knight move in his hand and thinks it is his imagination. However, it turns out that William broke the spell of an evil wizard, Alastor. The Silver Knight turns out to be a man named Sir Simon. His father was a King and Sir Simon was supposed to inherit the title after his father's death. However, Alastor got hold of the father and Sir Simon lost his inheritance. Alastor used a token to make Sir Simon turn to lead and shrinks him.William thinks of a plan to keep Mrs. Phillips with him. He uses the token to shrink Mrs. Phillips. Now, she is miserable being small in the castle. Sir Simon wants to return to his own land. William decides to go on the adventure with the Knight. In order to do this William has to have the courage to battle evil. He also has to show all the skill that he already possesses.It is truly a magical story and my kids cannot wait to read the sequel. It is definitely a must read. It was on my son's school reading list and I am glad it was!",

I won't tell you what he does because it would give away the ending. I think it is a good book because you want to know what happens. On a scale from one to five I would give it a four.This book was published in 1981 so its kind of old but still a good book.

I enjoyed this book and if you're an animal lover, you'll probably find a few scenes regarding them but it's not quite as good as her first two books in the series.Thea and Blaise are two cousins who have been expelled from five high schools because of Blaise's exploits. Unable to control her, Thea can only watch as Blaise toys with human boys and commands them to do her bidding.At their new school, things seem no different with Blaise setting her sights on Eric, a boy Thea is strangely attracted to. Amused by his refusal of Blaise, amusement soon turns to anxiety as Thea realises that her cousin is determined to make Eric desire her.Breaking the rule of never loving a human, Thea puts both her and Eric's life on the line as she tries to ward Blaise off.The two main characters (Blaise and Thea) are very well written and I could visualise them quite easily. They are both strong women and Blaise is not the complete ... that she seems to be. Nor is Thea the obedient, good girl she seems to be.Eric - and most human males in the series I must admit - is a bit of a weak character. When you really think about it, it's not that surprising. How can a weak human male compare to a cool, ruthless, strong vampire guy? He's not written in as much detail but you do get the general idea.There is a very good twist at the end and if you read carefully, you won't really guess it but you'll pick up small clues. Quite a bit of suspense and I liked the extra touch with the spirit.",

      "description": "With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",

The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt.",

I don't want to give anything away, but the lesson should give readers a different outlook on economics in general. He has great logic in making his case and the fact that he explains things so simply shows he has a deep understanding of the subject. The book doesn't go into really technical stuff, which should probably be expected given the title, but it explains the fundamental concepts of economics so well that the average person can move on to a more serious study of it.",

Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, \"Economics in One Lesson\" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do.

While it appeared first in 1946 (this edition was updated in 1979) the principles are as relevant today as they were then.The book is intended to emphasize general economic principles and \"the penalties for ignoring them\". Indeed, issues of inflation, deficit spending, commodity pricing, corporate profits, exports and taxes are very much with us today and look in our future.Economics, Hazlitt states, is the science of seeing both general consequences and secondary consequences. While much is made of the former, little is discussed of the latter and therein lies the danger. Government cannot give to one person or group without first taking from another. It creates nothing of value in that giving but in the taking it diminishes and discourages productivity and administers a negative effect on production and the creation of wealth. There is no justice in redistribution by force.Hazlitt writes profoundly of the dangers of inflation. He says, \"...all government spending must eventually be paid for out of the proceeds of taxation; that inflation itself is merely a form, and a particularly vicious form, of taxation\". Also, \"Inflation plants the seeds of fascism and communism. It leads men to demand totalitarian controls. It ends invariably in bitter disillusion and collapse.\" Strong stuff.On bureaucracy: \"The bureaucrats do not understand the quasi-automatic system of the market, they are always disturbed by it. They are always trying to improve it or correct it, usually in the interests of some wailing pressure group.\"Hazlitt has a gift for making the complex, simple and the abstract, concrete. This book is particularly well-written. In the current debates in Washington, D.C. Hazlitt's voice is one which needs to be heard above the shouting. It is the voice of reason, responsibility and experience. We would be wise to heed that voice.",

Should be renamed \"Libertarians are Cool.\" Yes, libertarianism is the foundation of modern economics and seems sensible. But this book is basically a libertarian manifesto shouted really loudly, with no objective evaluation in sight. It is NOT adequate substitution for an economics course, as I hoped it would be.The claim on the back of the book that it is written \"objectively and impartially\" is completely ridiculous; Hazlitt's approach is inflammatory and dogmatic. He compares taxes to \"being robbed\" (96), compares fixed prices to \"coercions\" (116), goes off on melodramatic tangents about evil government controls leading to \"final abandonment of all the traditional liberties we have known\" (123), and basically characterizes any government official as wicked and intending to steal from the masses and head towards \"the seeds of fascism and communism\" (176). Straight out of the cold war.What is peculiar is the fact that he does indeed concede that certain services should be paid with taxes (police, roads, etc.). Why can't those be private too? These implications of Hazlitt's libertarian theories are not explored; they are merely mentioned in apologetic passing. If taxes really are just a power trip, why have them at all? This question remains unanswered.Also, Hazlitt doesn't realize that his claims apply to things that he says, not just other people's purported \"foolery.\" He doesn't mind \"Industry X\" dying because it will \"release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries\" (102), but then gets all bent out of shape when another Industry X goes out of business due to minimum wage laws (136) by pointing out the resulting \"unemployment.\" Why is unemployment bad here, but okay before? He excuses unemployment in the first case as \"necessary\" and then calls out the second instance as \"condemning the people who worked in that industry\" (136). Which one is it? His decision to hide or showcase negative evidence rests solely on convenience, not truth.Read something else.",

He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace.",

Straight from the Ludwig von Mises school of thinking, this book made me realize one very important thing that most people that claim to know what they are talking about don't understand: economics is a science.For everyone that has had basic science, they understand the concept of laws. Physics has laws. Chemistry has laws. All sciences have laws, including economics. Reading this book (in early 2009) I would have thought that it was written shortly after the mortgage crisis of late 2008. Hazlitt wrote this book 60 years ago! Everything in the book could have been analogous to the current economic environment.My words cannot fully describe how intelligent, on target, and somewhat prophetic this book is, as it releates today. If you are even thinking about learning the first detail about economics, this is the only starting point for you.",

It should not be taken for a basic economics or introduction to economics manual.The chapters are short and very comprehensible, with a conspicuous lack of technical lingo, complicated graphs or strange data. They are especially advisable to those that want to understand conceptually, in a clear language, some of the inner workings of national microeconomics. One important remark is that the book focuses mainly on microeconomics, (explaining, for example, some effects of prices, consumers/producers behavior, etc) rather than on the big macroeconomics (balance of payments, growth, etc) or international economics issues (trade, FDI, etc).I like the point regarding one of the main troubles of modern-day economists: the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences...I think this not only is true but also applicable to other arenas, like politics. On the other hand, I think the author is too one-sided in his libertarian approach. He is plainly against government involvement and consistently overstates the role of rational markets and the evil of intervention.",

The fallacies Hazlitt demolishes are still passed around verbatim today as proverbial wisdom from the same 'brilliant' economists trotted out by the media, despite having failed to foresee the current crisis (late 2008).The world is rational. Read this book and you'll no longer be surprised by the frantic, panicked news chatter heard all around. There is nothing more special or unique about this current crisis. It is a truly predictable debacle and the direct consequence of belief in economic fallacy. Economic Law exists and its gravity will come to bear regardless of the attempts of interventionist actors. Nothing in this world comes for free.Hazlitt, drawing from the best traditions of Economics, lays it all out, neatly and succinctly. Strongly recommended.",

The rest of the book is a series of short chapters giving examples of the application of this lesson.Hazlitt's lesson in itself is great. I wish it were better known. His examples vary in quality. Some are a bit dated; natural for a book which mostly dates to 1946. The chapter on rent control is as relevant today as ever. The discussion of the cost of war and other types of destructive activities punctures a misconception that is still common. In his discussion of unemployment, however, he fails to mention immigration and population growth as part of the cause.The section on tariffs is good as far as it goes. The problem with his analysis is that transportation today is in effect heavily subsidized. Oil companies and the like don't have to pay for the air pollution and climate change caused by their products, or for roads, or for the armies protecting the oil flow. Subsidized transportation costs make nonsense of the idea that local and imported goods are really on the same footing. Free trade with countries having non-existent environmental laws simply sets up a race to the bottom, with responsible companies heading for bankruptcy and irresponsible companies destroying the economic foundations of their own countries.Hazlitt swallows whole the idea that growth in GNP is always good and can continue indefinitely. Given that GNP doesn't include the costs of pollution, resource depletion, the effects of population growth, or quality of life, this is very questionable. Hazlitt needs to apply his own &quot;one lesson&quot; here.Hazlitt states in his first sentence that economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. I tend to agree. Hazlitt points out some of them and does it in a very readable way. Hazlitt fails with some of the other fallacies. Read the book, but read it with a grain of salt.",

That was definitely not the case, for a number of reasons.First, the writing is not at all impressive. I know economists are not reputed to be particularly good writers, but come on, get yourself a good editor! Some of the sentences were so wordy and poorly constructed that I had to read them several times to figure out how the writer would have written them if he knew how to write at all. And THEN I had to figure out what the sentence said in terms of expanding my knowledge of economics. It was tedious, to say the least.Additionally, the organization of the text within the chapters needs a significant amount of work. The chapters meander; if you are the type of person who likes to organize a chapter's contents into a mental outline as you read, good luck. This author clearly didn't start with an outline, mental or otherwise. It's like he developed each chapter based on chats he had in his living room, which he asked someone to transcribe, then chunked up into paragraphs and called it done.The author also doesn't do a good job of explaining what different terms mean. What's the difference between a tax, a tariff, and a duty? Darned if I know, and I read about two-thirds of this book before deciding it definitely wasn't worth my time.I also found the content he describes in his chapters to be somewhat outdated. It's hard to get a grasp of economics when you're trying to relate what you know about how a particular system works in the present to the way he's discussing it as working in the past. As I mentioned, I have no background in economics, so I have no way of knowing whether the particular system he's discussing has undergone a massive overhaul at some point, such that the system he's describing no longer bears any resemblance to the system I know. If you can't figure out how to integrate what you're reading into your existing knowledge base, you can't expect to expand your knowledge base.I also wish the author were more up-front about his political bent from the outset, as this would have helped me to interpret what he was saying in the context of my own political views.Overall, I do not recommend this book at all. Maybe I'd have a different take if I had read it for a class I was taking, so that the instructor could fill in the blanks and help put certain things into context. But just reading it on my own, with no background in economics to draw on, was pointless.I'm going to try naked economics next. Reviews seem to indicate that it's written by an economist who can actually write.",

In much of the text, Hazlitt artfully debunks incorrect reasoning that often drives economic policy. Insofar as the book limits itself to that modest goal, it succeeds admirably. But when Hazlett more ambitiously attempts to purvey free market economics as singular truth the book falls painfully short.Hazlitt, like other free market economists, forgets that free market theory is only a pardigm. Free market thinking is useful to the extent that the conditions precedent to a free market are fulfilled; but no further. When the assumptions underlying free market thought are not met, the theory may fail. And in virtually ignoring this fact the book founders.For example, Hazlitt never mentions the problem of externalities which free markets inevitably fail to address. And his actors always conform to behavior convenient for free market theory. To paraphrase Garrison Keillor, Hazlett's universe is a paradise where all the markets are strong, all the investments are attractive and all the profits are above average.But there are other failings, too. The dislocations of a free market economy are generally trivialized. Unemployment is almost viewed as a benefit to workers when resultant from free market operations; as if a pink slip were a toll pass for the Yellow Brick Road leading to the Oz of more efficient employment. In several places Hazlitt is inconsistent, as when discussing the failure of marginal producers (a benefit when caused by free market processes in declining industries; an evil when caused by \"excessive\" wage demands by labor). Remarkably, he adverts to the \"inappropriate\" political power wielded by labor and farmers due to their disproportionate numbers, while never mentioning the truly undue influence that corporate largesse has on governing institutions. What Hazlett considers improper political influence most of us would consider functioning democracy.In summary, this book is a useful and brief introduction to free market economics. So long as one recognizes its limitations, well . . .no harm, no foul. But for true economic enlightenment you will have to look elsewhere.",

          "comment": "Economics in One Lesson is a clear and concise explanation of opportunity cost and price incentives. This book is extremely useful as a supplemental text. The reason why is that most modern economics textbooks pass over opportunity cost too quickly. The basic idea of opportunity cost is easy, but students need to see how the opportunity cost concept applies universally.One way to learn opportunity cost is to read Cost and Choice, by JM Buchanan. Cost and Choice is a great little book, but it does not work well for an intro class. Bastiat wrote some classic essays on opportunity cost, but his work could be seen as a little dated. Of course, opportunity cost is itself timeless, but Bastiat aimed at explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning to a nineteenth century audience.Economics in One Lesson is a modern restatement of Bastiat's essays. Hazlitt writes to counter mid twentieth century Keynesian fallacies. This is an important aim. All to many of us believe that disasters like 9-11 and Katrina created jobs. Too many of us fail to see that the labor and capital that goes into reconstruction has forgone alternative uses. Too many of us believe that capital itself causes unemployment by replacing labor. Labor saved by capital has alternative uses. Even some economists can benefit from reading this book (if they have an open mind) because too few of us see how government spending and credit expansion can displace and distort private sector spending. This is not to say that the free markets never have any slack or are perfect, but the Old Keynesian belief that activist fiscal and monetary policy can permanently increase real GDP is not well founded. Any New Keynesian will tell you that Hazlitt was right about the Old Keynesian economic program.Hazlitt also does fine explaining the basics of price incentives and price and wage controls. Many people will object to what Hazlitt writes about wage and price controls on ideological grounds, but his reasoning is sound. Even pro-minimum wage economists like David Card and Alan Kreuger admit that large increases minimum wage rates must cause increased unemployment. This is a basic lesson of economic theory.The critics of this book generally do not know what they are talking about. Sure Hazlitt does not discuss externalities or asymmetric information, but EIOL is not a comprehensive text, it's a primer on opportunity cost and price/wage controls. Keynesian critics will find fault in its discussions of unemployment, but the fact of the matter is that virtually all economists now reject the Keynesian paradigm that Hazlitt attacked in 1946, including contemporary self described Keynesians. Hazlitt is second only to Bastiat in explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning in an entertaining fashion, and his book is more up to date. All first year economics students should read Economics in One Lesson.",

He is against make work schemes, excessive taxes, public works, tariffs, a minimum wage, and unions. He is even critical of Social Security. This book was written originally in 1946 so there is no talk of the issue of Globalization and the numbers used are smaller than we are accustomed to, but otherwise it talks about timeless issues. I think it is important to remember that there are other ways of thinking about economics that are not so extreme in their opposition to public works, unions and a minimum wage. I also think that, although the market does correct itself without intervention and therefore the overall arguments of the author are correct, wages, for example, would be a lot lower if we did not have a minimum wage. Many minimum wage jobs require no skills and therefore there are lots of people to fill them so there is no competition for labor and therefore no incentive to offer higher wages.

I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.",

If you know nothing about the topic, read it, because it will save you from the pitfalls that have brough on most of modern economic errors. If you know much about economics, read it, because it will correct many tipically wrong notions of economics in your head. It is not meant to be a tratise, nor to solve all problems. Like all great books, it is a simple, concise, yet essential single lesson in economics. From a broken window glass it takes you through all main aspects of modern economics and teaches you an essential lesson: think about the unseen effects of economic policies and actions. Get that lesson wrong and you will find yourself in the midst of a third world economics mentality (which of course you may want, depending on your political position in life).",

          "comment": "Be advised: Mr. Hazlitt has a deep admiration for Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bastiat and approaches economics in much the same way. That his book is a heavy dose of free market economics thus should be no surprise. Neither should be his approach: that of judging economic policies in view of their total effects, not just on a favored interest group, but on all groups, and not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well. For over sixty years this is the tune Hazlitt has been singing. And surprisingly, it is a tune that still strikes a modern-day chord.Deficit spending, inflation, farm subsidies, trade tariffs--pick your modern day issue and you'll find a chapter or two directed to it here. Looking at each through what some might call an Austrian lens, Hazlitt focuses on their supposed fallacies in an upfront, un-intimidating manner. It makes for an enticing presentation--which is likely the reason for its stunning decades-long resilience--but admittedly, its age is beginning to show.The intricacies of modern finance are not to be untangled here, nor is the role of finance in modern economics even acknowledged. Similarly, though the importance of trade is trumpeted, the complexities of globalization are not to be forecast. For these issues, you'll have to turn to books like Greg Ip'sThe Little Book of Economics: How the Economy Works in the Real World (Little Books. Big Profits)or Alan Greenspan's surprisingly readableThe Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World(Tom Friedman'sThe World Is Flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Centuryalso isn't bad, but it is a bit too folksy). Approaching economics from an initial condition of equilibrium also seems a bit flat, if only because it describes an economy that doesn't exist.Hazlitt's prescience regarding the results of unnaturally low interest rates, deficit spending, and government subsidies of the housing market, however, are astonishingly accurate in view of the recent economic malaise. That government subsidized mortgages with little to no downpayment from buyers could lead to a glut of bad loans, an oversupply of housing, and a cancerous malinvestment of capital are lessons we are ruing today and risks he warned of decades ago. That we didn't recognize them sooner supports Mr. Hazlitt's ultimate conclusion that our problems are less economic than political, and, with the rest, makes his short little book on economics exceptionally enticing, if not surprisingly resilient.",

It is interesting that the author describes the housing bubble which he did not live to see (this has been pointed out by a number of other reviewers), but what I find just as interesting, the section on imports and exports shows very clearly why making the USD the world's reserve currency has had (and continues to have) a destructive effect on the US economy (since it creates an impetus to hoard dollars [exactly what the chinese are doing] as opposed to spending them on US-produced goods).What I also find interesting (and depressing) is that a lot of the reviews of this are \"religious\": look at all of the one-star reviews -- none of them have any logical objection to Hazlitt, but they all say that they are (in effect) religiously opposed to it. Until people (and Amazon book reviewers are probably slightly more sentient than average) learn to think, we will continue on the current road to ruin.(the above was written before I had actually finished the book: now that I have I am even more impressed, because the last three chapters, on Inflation, Savings, and Lessons learned are eerily relevant to the current crisis, and the last chapter is particularly depressing, since, despite Hazlitt's hope, the governments STILL are going on their merry way making things worse).",

Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he come over as extremely objective because he doesn't need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won't offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you.Comment Comment | Permalink | Why no voting buttons?

          "comment": "This is an edited version of a review that I'd previously removed. People didn't feel the first version was helpful, a fact which I suspect to be due to two possibilities, depending upon the individuals involved. For one thing, it was very long. For another, although it praised Halzitt on many points, it was not an obeisant psalm that accepted without question every single thing he asserted (this was the problem for one highly emotional commentator).So out of sensitivity to the preciousness of readers' time, I offer a shorter version. I am, however, still a skeptic and agnostic when it comes to economic schools of thought, so if you worship at the alter of Smith (or even Marx, Keynes, or indeed, any of the august minds that have turned their hand to this soft science), I'm afraid this review will not be for you.Economics In One Lesson (written in 1946, re-published with some updating in 1978) was intended as a layman's introduction to free-market arguments against the continuation of New Deal policies in the postwar era. Halzitt writes beautifully, always respecting the intelligence of the reader. He neither inundates with professional jargon nor clutters up the pages with tons of tables and graphs. He explains and illustrates thoroughly yet not exhaustively. The result is a highly approachable work that has remained popular for decades.Hazlitt's arguments are cogent and it is easy to find plenty of merit in them. However, they are often strongest where they are obsolete. His descriptions of how credit works are downright touching in their quaintness (think: the Bailey Building and Loan in \"It's a Wonderful Life\"). In EIOL, there is nothing resembling the kinds of byzantine credit shenanigans which have caused so much trouble of late.Another weakness of the book is that many of the claims made in the original were not re-visited in 1978. Halzitt complained in '46, for example, that the GI Bill was extending credit hither and yon without the tough standards necessary to protect the investment. Halzitt failed to add a footnote in the '78 version letting us know how his dire predictions of mass default turned out. Readers are left to speculate that perhaps the catastrophe never materialized.On the fundamental level, Halzitt falls prey to the quintessential free-market fallacy - an unshakable belief in self-interested rationalism on the part of the capital class. But of course contemporary readers know that racism, sexism and other psychological blind spots historically prevented otherwise worthy credit risks from receiving a fair shake and that government interventions of various kinds have been required to address the problem. Halzitt acknowledges none of this.Finally, historical experience has not been kind to Halzitt's view of things. Halzitt recommends deregulation and unqualified tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They will re-invest in the market, we are told, and the economy will grow. New businesses will come into being or old ones will expand. Jobs will appear, production will rise, more money and goods will come into circulation and everyone will be richer. Reaganomics used the term \"trickle down theory.\"But under Reagan, things did not go quite as planned (corporations and the rich found other uses for their increased funds) and by the end of George H. Bush's only term, we were deep in recession. Further deregulation under Clinton and Bush II does not seem to have been much help in building economic sustainability.Perhaps this book's greatest strength lies in teaching critical thinking about economic thought itself. While Hazlitt's specific critiques against continuation of the New Deal and the abuses of unionized labor did have merit, it is his general thesis - that selfish interests will blind people to some important aspect of any given policy's total outcome - is unassailably true, with a capital T.Just remember to turn the same critical eye upon Hazlitt, too.",

I mean... libertarians speak as though the game is over and they have \"won\" in that the correctness of their theory has been fully confirmed.The ancient Greeks during the period of the Athenian empire were the proponents of the most archetypal (and one of the earliest) forms of democracy. Imagine if, after the Peloponnesian war and the fall of the Athenian empire to a Spartan puppet state, someone had declared that democracy was a failed experiment! The course of history certainly does not bear out that presumption. I hear echoes of this sentiment among the hard-line right wing, who speak as though the entire course of human history has culminated in modern times and has now been vindicated in the form of democracy.The socialists don't fare any better. The arguments against them are grounded in such common sense and indisputable fact that they scarcely need to be listed. People like to own stuff. Plus, J. M. Keynes still owes me $2... the cheapskate.The fact is that socialism is an inevitability in a world where the ever-increasing world population renders individual choice more and more meaningless. As powerful as a relatively few individuals may become, those few will always depend on the masses more than vice versa.Marx and Engels foolishly sought to bypass the democratic/free-enterprise/industrial step in economic development, and in so doing rendered their brand of socialism ineffective and that school of thinking has taken on an air of anachronism. You can't side-step the aformentioned phase in socio-economic development any more than you can side-step learning to add before attempting to multiply! Before the proletariat has any reason to overtake the plutocratic \"haves\", they must be beaten down and humiliated for generations.I am personally neither a socialist or libertarian. I am an observer who tends to shy away from systematic doctrine simply because it is useless in explaining such ineffable phenomena as human choice and behaviour. I respect those economists who embrace the chaotic nature of such phenomena and attempt to use them to their advantage.I just ordered this book from Amazon, and I can't wait to read it! Perhaps the game isn't over just yet.EDIT: Having read the book many times over now, I have to say I am truly impressed. It is much more unbiased than you might assume.

This version of Economics has recently come to the mainstream in light of the economic hardships and out of control spending from the federal government. This book is dated but contains a lot of relevant information. I was surprised to see just how big of a concern inflation and deficit spending was in the 40s to these very intelligent and honest economists.What will you find inside? Well the bottom line is everything you do, no matter how noble, affects someone else in the world of economics. If the government steps in to help one group of people it is hurting another group of people, usually resulting in a net harm. This is because anytime you artificially stimulate, subsidize or promote one behavior over another you are promoting inefficiency or protecting the least profitable option. This raises prices on goods and decreases real wages. The only way to create wealth and grow the economy is to produce more of a product with the same or less effort. This will in the long run make everyones cost of living lower and bring more prosperity to the country. A great example he used was the hypothetical situation where the government continued to subsidize the horse and buggy industry despite the innovation of the automobile. Sure jobs were lost when cars started replacing horse drawn carriages but eventually more jobs were created and the country was a whole lot better off. He also dispels the myth of saving too much money and discusses why it's necessary to save and what your savings accomplishes.Other discussions include real world examples of why labor unions are harmful to the economy, why it's bad to raise minimum wage, evils of price fixing, the problem with subsidizing, rent stabilization and who it hurts, inequities and harm of tariffs, and much much more. I deduct a star from the book because it got a little repetitive after awhile. A lot of the arguments are repeated and there is a definite recurring theme in every problem he poses. This is not to detract from it's validity, and each problem does propose a unique flavor of this principle. A lot of these things I knew were intuitively wrong but the examples he gives makes you nod your head and puts your gut thought into words. This book was a refreshingly easy read and very insightful.",

      "rate": "1.5/5",
      "description": "The doctrine of \"Islamic economics\" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.",

The author does not seem well-versed in the history of the Islamic world nor does he understand Islamic economics. He picks up few concepts he thinks will lead him to the conclusions he already knew, so he squeezes Islamic economics into a small area. Contrary to his claims, the main factor leading to the economic decline of the modern Muslim world is the adoption of Marxist ideology - almost every single Muslim country has adopted a Communist regime (leading to political repression by definition). This is not Islamic but rather Jewish Economics. Another factor, among others, would be colonization. Professor Kuran is not an expert on Islam, he would have done better had he sought endeavors in other areas that do not require rigorous empirical testing, perhaps literary work?.",

Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader.",

This book however is bigger than simply the above elements, as it describes a business philosophy. Arie de Geus is a respected business scenarioist and strategist. He developed his craft over many years in a leading multinational organisation and therefore is well equipped to talk about globalism and evolution. This book passes on that craft in the form of a circumspect view from a man consumate in the art of business. He proposes that businesses be: receptive (sensitive) to the commercial environment and opportunity; have an all embracing organisational culture; tolerant of new ideas and have a conservative approach to financing and investment. But above all he proposes that the raison d'etre of companies is not simply profit, rather it is corporate longevity through embracing the above four propositions. He also suggests that today's principal corporate activity is simply a current commercial phase capable of being superseded by some other activity at some later date. In other words, our respective successful business activities and opportunities are only today's fashions! Equipped with such a suggestion, perhaps we are all able to better approach our strategising with renewed objectivity and circumspection. Callum Morrison.",

The theme was well developed - perhaps more rigorously - in Collins' and Porras' Built to Last.De Geus' contribution is therefore one of providing a human perspective, in some ways giving an idea of what it is like as a person or as a manager to work in a company which is alive. In this he succeeds.I must admit my view was tinged a little by my experiences as a manager in the Royal Dutch/Shell group of the 90's, dealing with the consequences of massive errors in the allocation of capital, many of which happened under Mr. de Geus's watch as Planning Coordinator. Whether Shell will be able to resist the misguided pressures of its shareholders (and of highly paid consultants) and stay a living company remains to be seen.Nevertheless, an excellent contribution, with much wisdom.",

      "description": "\"Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers.\" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.",

          "comment": "As I have often noted this space is dedicated to the struggles of the American (and international) working class and their allies. Part of understanding those struggles is to know where we have been in order to have a better grasp of where we need to head in order to create a more just, socially inclined world. In my travels over the past few years I have noted, even among those who proclaim themselves progressives, radicals and revolutionaries, a woeful, and in some cases willful, lack of knowledge about the history and traditions of the American labor movement. In order to help rectify that lack I will, occasionally, post entries relating to various events, places and personalities that have helped form what was a very militant if, frustratingly, apolitical (or not purely anti-political, especially against its left-wing) labor history.In order to provide a starting point for these snapshots in time I am using what I think is a very useful book, \"Labor's Untold Story\", Richard O. Boyer and Herbert Morais, United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers Of America (UE), New York, 1976, that I can recommend to all those militants interested in getting at least a first taste of what the once mighty organized American labor movement was all about. For those unfamiliar with labor history the UE, cited here as the publisher, was a left-wing union that was split by the main labor federations during the \"red scare\" of the 1950's for being \"under Communist influence\" and refusing to expel its Communist Party supporters. The other organization created at the time was the International Brotherhood Of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The history of that split and its timing that caused a wasteful break in the struggle for a single industry-wide union that has been the goal of all thoughtful labor militants will, of course, be the subject of one of these entries at a later date.That UE imprimatur, for this writer at least, is something of a plus but you know upfront that this is a pro-labor history. That said, this 400 page book is chock full of events, large and small, complete with very helpful footnotes giving greater detail (mercifully placed at the bottom of the page where the subject is mentioned), that helped turned the American labor movement from an atomized, motley group of conflicting racial, ethnic and political tendencies in the last part of the 19th century to something like a very powerful and somewhat self-confident organized force by the 1940's. After that period there is a long term decline that, for the book, ends with the period of the \"red scare\" noted above and for the rest of us continues until today.In any case here you will learn about the embryonic stages of the modern labor movement after the American Civil War with its urgent industrial demands to provide goods for a pent-up market war-ravaged market and creation of a transportation and information system adequate to meet those needs. Needless to say labor received short shrift in the bargain, especially at first before it was even minimally organized. The story here it should be made clear, the story anytime labor is the subject of discourse, is organized labor. The atomized working class as a whole minus this organization does not exist as a historical force. That, my friends, is a great lesson for today as well.As such, it important to note the establishment in the 1870s of the National Labor Union and its offshoots, later the Knights of Labor and the role of its class collaborationist leaders. Also noted is the fight in the coal mines of the East and the legendary saga of the \"Molly McGuires\" in Pennsylvania our first well-know labor martyrs. Then the fight moves west to the lead, copper, silver and gold mines. That push west can only mean the establishment of the Western Federation of Miners, the emergence of the paragon of an American labor leader Big Bill Haywood, his frame-up for murder in 1905 and the subsequent rise of the Industrial Workers of The World. Wobblies (IWW). Along the way there are various attempts to form a workers party, the most promising, if amorphous, being the Tom Watson-led Populist Party in 1892 before the somewhat more class-based Socialist Party took hold.Of course no political study of the American working class is complete without a big tip o f the hat to the tireless work of Eugene V. Debs, his labor organizing and his various presidential campaigns up through 1920. While today Debs' efforts have to be seen in different way in light of the fact that our attitude toward labor militants running for executive offices in the capitalist state and his `soft' attitude on the question of the political organization of the working class with an undifferentiated party of the whole class, he stands head and shoulders above most of the other political labor leaders of the day, especially that early renegade from Marxism, Samuel Gompers.The first \"red scare\" (immediately after World War I) and its effect on the formation of the first American communist organizations responding to the creation of the first workers state in Russian ( and of the establishment of the internationally-oriented Communist International), the quiescent of the American labor movement in the 1920s (a position not unlike the state of the American working class today), the rise of the organized labor movement into a mass industrial organization in response to the ups and downs of the Great Depression, the `labor peace' hiatus of World War II, the labor upsurge in the immediate post-World War II period and the \"night of the long knives\" of the anti-communist \"red scare\" of the 1950s brings the story up to the time of first publication of the book. As to be expected of a book that pre-dates the rise of the black civil right movement, the women's liberation movement and the struggle for gay and lesbian rights there is much less about the role of race and gender the history of the American labor movement. Not to worry, the black, feminist and gender scholars have been hard at work rectifying those omissions. And I have been busy reviewing that work elsewhere in this space. But here is your start.",

I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who owns a business, is thinking of owning a business or just wants to better understand what the finance world looks like from the outside.It takes a black-box perspective on the subject to avoid dragging the reader into all the minute details while still giving the reader plenty to chew on, like COGS, depreciation, lease vs. buy decisions, and inventory valuation. The intent of this book is not to teach the reader to be an accountant but rather a book to teach the businessperson how to better use accounting as a tool so they can be more effective.And I *love* to use of the example small business of Rosie's Spouse Houses to tie each accounting concept directly to specific \"real-world\" situations. The great use of humor really helps break up what can be a relatively unpalatable topic.The only place this book falls a little short (but for good reason - it's already a long book!) is on financial statement analysis.

If the stock is so wonderful, does the broker have it in his or her own portfolio? Next week, some other stock will be \"about to take off.\" The investor can also expect a call from a broker saying that their mutual funds or municipal bonds perform much better than what the investor is in now. How about a switch? More transactions equals more commissions. Wall Street does not do anything for free. Even if something sounds \"no fee\" or \"no-load,\" the brokerage will get its fee somewhere.The investor should certainly keep up with the business news, but do not spend hours and hours every day at it; that will not leave any time for actual trading. Go through the Sunday paper and come up with a list of buying possibilities. These are May Buy stocks, as opposed to Will Buy. Just some basic information is needed about each stock, like its 52-week high/low and yesterday's close. If a stock is down at least 20% from its 52-week high (not 19.5%), move it onto your Will Buy list. When choosing a broker, is it really worth going through several minutes of Press 1 and Press 2, before you reach a human, while the price of your stock goes in the wrong direction, all to save a few dollars on the commission? Pay the extra commission, and choose a broker where a human really is just a phone call away.It is easy to buy a stock, but much harder to know when to sell it. If your stock rises from 20% to 10% below its 52-week high, sell it. Do not get greedy, and wait for it to rise just one more point; it may never come. There will be other opportunities. Besides, a double digit profit in the stock market is nothing to scoff at. On the other hand, if your stock continues to slide into oblivion, know when to cut your losses. There will be other stocks.This book seems to be much easier to understand than the stock trading \"systems\" advertised on TV and in the Business section of the local book store. The experienced investor may kick themselves, realizing the money they have given to Wall Street, for little or no reason. It is also recommended for novice investors, and even non-investors (like yours truly).",

Although the information provided isn't anything new, it was a slap in the face to make me stop my destructive investing habits.",

      "author": "Nelson Lichtenstein",
      "rate": "2.2/5",
      "description": "A collection of essays that “do an incredible job of balancing the wonders and horrors of the force that is Wal-Mart” (Booklist, starred review). Edited by one of the nation’s preeminent labor historians, this book marks an ambitious effort to dissect the full extent of Wal-Mart’s business operations, its social effects, and its role in the United States and world economy. Wal-Mart is based on a spring 2004 conference of leading historians, business analysts, sociologists, and labor leaders that immediately attracted the attention of the national media, drawing profiles in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the New York Review of Books. Their contributions are adapted here for a general audience. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Pennsylvania Railroad declared itself “the standard of the world.” In more recent years, IBM and then Microsoft seemed the template for a new, global information economy. But at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Wal-Mart had overtaken all rivals as the world-transforming economic institution of our time. Presented in an accessible format and extensively illustrated with charts and graphs, Wal-Mart examines such topics as the giant retailer’s managerial culture, revolutionary use of technological innovation, and controversial pay and promotional practices to provide the most complete guide yet available to one of America’s largest companies. “Like archaeologists who pick over artifacts to understand an ancient society, the scholars here [are] examining Wal-Mart for insights into the very nature of American capitalist culture.” —The New York Times “Stimulating perspectives on the world’s largest corporation.” —Publishers Weekly",

          "comment": "Neither a polemic nor a whitewash, this book is critical yet strives to be fair. Its perspective is predominantly historical and a bit too academic, but it is well written and simply fascinating.Sam Walton was a natural salesman, passionate about building his retail business. When founded Wal-Mart in 1962, he did not entertain any dream of becoming the wealthiest man in America or creating the world's largest company. Instead, he wanted to bring big-city discounting to his corner of the rural American South, which would cut about 20% off the prices in local stores. But he wanted the discounts to be offered every day, rather than by one-time sales promotions of selected items. He chose to expand locally, opening stores in his native Arkansas and spreading slowly into Oklahoma, Missouri, and Louisiana. Thus, as the book points out, Wal-Mart's culture reflects where it was born, where its salaries were viewed as fair and people could live reasonably well on them and in a context without strong unions or organized workers.Walton's strategy was simple: to make up for his low profit margins, he would have to sell in higher volumes of sales in a large number of stores. In addition, his company developed a relentless drive to lower costs by going directly to manufacturers and constantly increasing worker productivity, which often translated into low salaries for a high-turnover work force. He also paid close attention to the competition as well as trained Wal-Mart workers to treat customers with courtesy and consideration of their needs. It was a phenomenal success. In 1985, with just under 1,000 stores, he was named by Forbes Magazine as the richest man in America. By 1991, Wal-Mart was recognized as America's largest retailer as it began to expand overseas. It was repeatedly hailed as the most admired company in America.In the aftermath of Walton's death, the expansion of the company accelerated with a combination of new technologies (the \"logistics revolution\") and the globalization of its operations. By 2004, Wal-Mart was number one on the Fortune 500 list, as both the world's largest corporation and the largest non-governmental employer.From the mid-1990s, Wal-Mart became a pioneer in technology-driven productivity enhancement. Elements included: 1) point-of-sale data collection, enabling managers to track inventory and demand in real time; 2) data mining in order to exploit trends to boost sales via novel merchandising techniques, e.g. placing diapers and six packs of beer near store entryways on Fridays, to exploit a spike in demand for both items at the end of the workweek; 3) the establishment of a just-in-time delivery system, which suppliers and distributors were obligated to participate in and obey, in effect joining Wal-Mart's data network. According to a widely cited estimate by McKinsey and Co., Wal-Mart alone was responsible for 25% of the \"gain in productivity\" of the U.S. economy from 1995 to 1999! Many of these efficiency gains, the company claimed, were passed directly on to consumers in the form of lower prices. Wal-Mart, the company said, saved U.S. consumers over $100 billion per year.Combined with its sheer size (Wal-Mart accounts for approximately 10% of all retail sales in the U.S.!) these technological capabilities enabled Wal-Mart to exert an unprecedented degree of control not only over its business partners (independent manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors), but over its employees as well.On the one hand, this represents a fundamental shift of market power to the retailer, which traditionally had served as outlets for manufacturers. In practical terms, this meant that Wal-Mart could force its partners to set prices at whatever levels that the retailer deemed desirable, which translated into direct control of both their marketing through Wal-Mart stores and in many cases, even the manufacturers' brand. Given the imperative of cost containment, this tends to cut their profit margins to the bone. In the case of Vlasic pickles, for example, some have argued that Wal-Mart's insistence that the company lower prices led to its bankruptcy as well as derailed its brand strategy for high quality at slightly higher prices. One the other hand, managers in Wal-Mart headquarters are able track the productivity of workers in its individual stores, allowing them to push for \"improvements\", allegedly as unpaid over-time and refusal to take breaks, which many critics charged were degrading and often illegal.Wal-Mart's size and reach attracted many critics, who condemn its practices and began to mount protest campaigns against the company. Their tactics include grassroots campaigns to block the establishment of new Wal-Mart Supercenters, targeted consumer boycotts, a barrage of media attacks (in films and television, on the internet, and in print), and efforts to unionize Wal-Mart associates. In addition, the company became the object of a growing number of lawsuits (on average two per hour, 365 days per year!) from both current and former employees and customers, including many class-action suits.Wal-Mart's critics argue passionately that the company had to change in a variety of ways. First, they believe, Wal-Mart had to somehow lessen its impact on the communities that it entered. As it stood, they charge, Wal-Mart not only destroys local \"mom and pop\" stores that could not compete on price, which sometimes turn traditional downtown shopping areas from vital social centers into ghost towns, but also generate such second-hand effects of increased traffic, reduced demand for other local businesses such as newspapers, additional infrastructure costs that create new tax burdens. Second, Wal-Mart's labor practices, which they believe are brutal and unfair, have to change. The company, they demand, should allow associates to unionize, offer better wages and health insurance benefits, and treat them more humanely. Moreover, critics claim, Wal-Mart's labor practices were dragging down those of its unionized competitors, who were asking employees to \"bargain away\" their higher salaries, pension plans, and other benefits in order for the companies to survive. Third, they argue, Wal-Mart has to provide a more equitable management of its supply chain, from \"sweatshop\" workers in China to the company's truckers as well as its manufacturing partners. This often means that the company should pay more for the goods and services it buys.This criticism amounts to nothing less than a fundamental repudiation of Wal-Mart's business model, which in the words of one critic in this book, \"can flourish only by externalizing many of its most important social and economic costs, which are displaced onto a relentlessly squeezed supply chain, an underpaid retail work force, and those many thousand communities...which have been forced to absorb so many intangible expenses...\" Even worse, evidence suggests that the criticism resonated with a growing portion of the public. In a 2004 confidential McKinsey & Co., it was reported, between 2 and 8% of the public had ceased to shop at Wal-Mart due to the \"negative press\" about the company. Most alarming to Wal-Mart executives, however, was the disapproval of more affluent, middle class consumers in urban areas, that is, the group that the company had identified as the market that it must next enter if its growth rates were to improve or even be sustained.This is about where the book stops, which is unfortunate given the things that have happened recently. As media campaigns against the company grew in 2004, Wal-Mart President and CEO Lee Scott decided to mount a counter-offensive. In its aim respond directly to the claims of critics, this represented a new departure for the company. After hiring the public relations firm Edelman, the company created a rapid-response \"war room\" in summer, 2005. Among the tasks of the group was the cultivation of a more positive image of the company - as environmentally aware and more worker friendly - in the minds of the \"swing voters\" who had not yet decided against shopping at Wal-Mart. It wants to be viewed as a good guy again, which in my opinion is a dubious proposition.The next phase of the story is whether or not this new PR will work. The company certainly got lots of praise for its Katrina relief efforts, and deservedly so if you ask me. But the opposition to the company will persist. My advice is: hold onto your seats because it's gonna be a heckuva ride. For example, just after Scott announced some progressive measures, such as a new health care plan and some environmental initiatives, foes of the company released a leaked internal memo (on strategies to keep employees off the company health care plans) with perfect political timing: the vilification was intense, focusing on how the leopard may not really have changed its spots. These opposition groups are media-savvy and driven - and they will not stop. I have interviewed some of them, and to say the least, they are passionate about their mission, which is not just to block Wal-Mart but on how to shape the direction in which their communities will develop. Instead of asking \"how many jobs\", they are looking at what kinds of jobs are being created. In my view, this represents a fundamentally new kind of social movement and Wal-Mart had better take heed.Recommended as the best book I have yet read on the company. While it is predominantly historical, it explains many useful things about the company that are unavailable elsewhere. Also, there are wonderful histories about the retail trade.",

      "description": "The authors of the New York Times bestseller Crucial Conversations show you how to achieve personal, team, and organizational success by healing broken promises, resolving violated expectations, and influencing good behavior Discover skills to resolve touchy, controversial, and complex issues at work and at home--now available in this follow-up to the internationally popular Crucial Conversations. Behind the problems that routinely plague organizations and families, you'll find individuals who are either unwilling or unable to deal with failed promises. Others have broken rules, missed deadlines, failed to live up to commitments, or just plain behaved badly--and nobody steps up to the issue. Or they do, but do a lousy job and create a whole new set of problems. Accountability suffers and new problems spring up. New research demonstrates that these disappointments aren't just irritating, they're costly--sapping organizational performance by twenty to fifty percent and accounting for up to ninety percent of divorces. Crucial Confrontations teaches skills drawn from 10,000 hours of real-life observations to increase confidence in facing issues like: An employee speaks to you in an insulting tone that crosses the line between sarcasm and insubordination. Now what? Your boss just committed you to a deadline you know you can't meet--and not-so-subtly hinted he doesn't want to hear complaints about it. Your son walks through the door sporting colorful new body art that raises your blood pressure by forty points. Speak now, pay later. An accountant wonders how to step up to a client who is violating the law. Can you spell unemployment? Family members fret over how to tell granddad that he should no longer drive his car. This is going to get ugly. A nurse worries about what to say to an abusive physician. She quickly remembers \"how things work around here\" and decides not to say anything. Everyone knows how to run for cover, or if adequately provoked, step up to these confrontations in a way that causes a real ruckus. That we have down pat. Crucial Confrontations teaches you how to deal with violated expectations in a way that solves the problem at hand, and doesn't harm the relationship--and in fact, even strengthens it. Crucial Confrontations borrows from twenty years of research involving two groups. More than 25,000 people helped the authors identify those who were most influential during crucial confrontations. They spent 10,000 hours watching these people, documented what they saw, and then trained and tested with more than 300,000 people. Second, they measured the impact of crucial confrontations improvements on organizational and team performance--the results were immediate and sustainable: twenty to fifty percent improvements in measurable performance.",

In its latest reading, I used this book for a book study at work, guiding my team (I'm their boss) through the book and the lessons in the book. The team had been largely dysfunctional, had serious problems with communication, apparently had no idea of how to deal with confrontations, and might very well have imploded completely. Over the course of a few months, we read this book chapter by chapter (with some breaks), discussed each of the lessons, and started to put them into play.Today, the team communicates far better, has become highly functional, has improved their interpersonal skills, and are a joy to work with.Several of the team said that they were already starting to put some of the things they'd learned into practice in their personal lives, and I can see them applying them at work daily.The lessons that you can glean from this book are HUGE. If you find yourself struggling to have real conversations about issues small and large, if you have a relationship that is in some jeopardy, or if you just want to be more effective in a leadership or teaming role, read these books.For instance, the idea of mastering your stories... what is it that you assume about the motivations of the other person, and how do those assumptions generate feelings which drive YOUR behaviors? Learning about your \"stories\", how to discuss them with others, and how that affects you could be the start of something wonderful for you.Read these books. Now.",

Since posting the review, a reader's comment (please see below) identifies an essay that brings into doubt the common belief in the dual meaning to which I referred. However, I remain convinced, linguistic issues aside, that every crisis does pose both peril or opportunity and that how we respond is for us to determine.* * *As those who have been or are now involved in process simplification initiatives already know, every problem encountered offers a valuable learning opportunity. The same is also true when encountering \"broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior\" either within or beyond the workplace. The authors of this volume address questions such as these:What's a \"crucial confrontation\"?What to do before one occurs?How to know when -- and when NOT -- to initiate one?How to \"get your head right before opening your mouth\"?How to begin a crucial confrontation?How to involve and engage others to take appropriate action?How to make keeping commitments (almost) painless?What to do when others \"get sidetracked, scream, or sulk\"?What to do after a crucial confrontation?How to gain commitment and move to action?How to solve \"big, sticky, complicated problems\"?How to deal with the truly tough? (i.e. the twelve \"yeh buts\")The authors also provide four appendices: A self-assessment for measuring confrontation skills, \"The Six-Source Model,\" \"When Things Go Right,\" and discussion questions for reading groups. Although any one of the appendices is worth far more than the cost of this book, their greatest value will be derived when the information and counsel are correlated with the material which the authors share in the nine chapters.My own experience in the business world suggests that \"broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior\" really do offer both perils and opportunities. A careful reading of this book and then an equally careful application of the advice which the authors offer will, in my opinion, help reduce (if not eliminate) the former while helping to achieve effective fulfillment of the latter.",

Maps, photographs, and beautiful illustrations decorate the narrative, helping young readers visualize what life was like in sixteenth-century England. More importantly, they will learn the story of an extraordinary young girl who understood that she was saved only by the mercy of God and the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ.",

I ever saw the movie Lady Jane of which the book based but I knew about Jane as the Nine Day queen and thought this book would be a novel of that. Instead it appears to be a word for word retelling of the movie which no visual element at all. I mean, Jane and her husband became lovers in one spot, but the only clue I had to that happening was that the next morning they were talking about how they didn't hate each other. There wasn't even a break in the paragraph from talking at night to talking in the morning! Where was the sex? Also Guilford (the husband) goes from being an ass to a wonderful person in about five minutes!I can't recommend this-its lacking too much.One star",
