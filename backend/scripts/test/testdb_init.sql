By systematically examining the New Testament's teaching on the existence, meaning, and purpose of the church, providing responsible coverage of the traditional topics in ecclesiology, and carefully grounding ecclesiology in the person and work of Christ, Ferguson unveils a comprehensive model of the church that is both biblically centered and relevant to a world on the verge of the twenty-first century.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kVqRaiPlx88C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=kVqRaiPlx88C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Church+of+Christ:+A+Biblical+Ecclesiology+for+Today&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=kVqRaiPlx88C&dq=The+Church+of+Christ:+A+Biblical+Ecclesiology+for+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api	Wm.

Positive feedback highlights the book’s depth, thorough research, rich exegesis, and its utility as a resource for ministers and students. Criticisms point to occasional excessive technical detail and insufficient coverage of certain debated topics like miraculous gifts and women's roles. Overall, it's recommended for serious students of ecclesiology.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
2	Voices from the Farm: Adventures in Community Living	Twenty-five years ago, at the height of the counter-culture movement, several hundred hippies drove their school buses into southern Tennessee and founded America's largest, modern-day intentional community, The Farm. In its heyday, the community was home to over 1,200 optimistic young people and the young-at-heart. Their purpose for coming together was to experiment with alternative lifestyles that could help raise the standard of living for impoverished people around the world while conserving the planet's resources. The results of these experiments were not always predictable, but were always interesting, and created lasting bonds among community members that are still strong today. The Farm remains a vibrant, working environment for change. Why has it lasted so long? Discover the answers as members past and present recount some of their more memorable experiences.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjTABgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjTABgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Voices+from+the+Farm:+Adventures+in+Community+Living&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IjTABgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Book Publishing Company	2012-08-21	{"Biography & Autobiography"}	1	"Voices from The Farm" offers a compelling collection of first-hand accounts from the early days of The Farm, a well-known intentional community in Tennessee.

3	The Battleship Bismarck	The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous – and notorious – warship ever built. Completed in 1941, the 45,000-ton German battleship sank HMS Hood, the pride of the British Navy, during one of the most sensational encounters in naval history. Following the sinking, Bismarck was chased around the North Atlantic by many units of the Royal Navy. She was finally dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes on 27 May, less than five months after her completion. Her wreck still lies where she sank, 4,800m down and 960km off the west coast of France. Drawing on new research and technology, this edition is the most comprehensive examination of Bismarck ever published. It includes a complete set of detailed line drawings with fully descriptive keys and full-colour 3D artwork, supported by technical details, photographs and text on the building of the ship and a record of the ship's service history.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Battleship+Bismarck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Bloomsbury Publishing	2018-09-20	{History}	1	This book serves as a historical account and photo album of the German battleship Bismarck, showcasing its construction and interior through numerous photographs. While the visual content is valuable, the book has notable shortcomings. It was published in 1975 and fails to incorporate updated information, leading to outdated claims, particularly about the Bismarck's timeline. The translation is problematic, with literal interpretations that misrepresent naval terms, making the narrative unclear. Additionally, factual errors persist regarding historical events and figures, such as the number of German sailors rescued. Despite this, the extensive collection of historic images makes it a worthwhile purchase for some readers.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
4	Tess and the Highlander	In 1543, on a windswept isle off of Scotland, seventeen-year-old Tess finds a young man half alive in a tidal pool while a great storm rages around them, but little does Tess know that this stranger holds the key to her mysterious past and to her heart.

92	Man Who Planted Trees	‘A book for children from 8 to 80. I love the humanity of this story and how one man’s efforts can change the future for so many. It’s a real message of hope.’ Michael Morpurgo Discover this beloved masterpiece of nature writing that is a hymn to creation and to the power of the individual to do their bit to change the world for the better. In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley. Elzéard’s solitary, silent work continues and the narrator returns year after year to see the miracle he is gradually creating: a verdant, green landscape that is a testament to one man’s creative instinct. A beautiful story of hope, survival and selflessness, The Man Who Planted Trees resonates as strongly with readers today as when it was first published.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Man+Who+Planted+Trees&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Random House	2015-01-29	{Fiction}	8	The reviews praise Frediric Back's illustrations for their warmth and sentimental value, enhancing the story significantly. On the negative side, there is strong criticism directed at American publishers for restricting English language versions of this public domain story, which goes against the author Jean Giorno's original intent. This commercial exploitation is viewed as a stark contrast to the story's principles, and readers are advised to avoid supporting such publishers.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Reviewers praise its emphasis on maintaining personal identity while fostering partnership growth. However, some criticize its outdated language and assumptions, noting that the authors themselves divorced, which some deem undermining. Critics misinterpret its association with sexual freedom, whereas the book is more about personal freedom and mutual understanding in marriage. Although certain examples may feel dated, the foundational ideas remain valuable in enhancing relationships. Some feel modern polyamory books offer more practical insights. Overall, it’s recommended for enhancing relationship dynamics.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Readers find the book to be a profound testament to resilience and healing, particularly through faith, highlighting Dorie's journey from tragedy to forgiveness and ministry. While readers praise its eye-opening and motivational aspects, it may not serve as a typical self-help book for those seeking guidance unrelated to such specific trauma.

Laurel is falsely accused, prompting Perry Mason to uncover clues and ultimately reveal the true murderer during a dramatic courtroom scene. While praised for incorporating updated procedures and maintaining the formulaic Mason plot, the book receives criticism for lacking the original series' dedicated charm and style, typical of Gardner's 1930s and 40s work. Characters have evolved, including Paul Drake Jr. as the investigator and a friendlier Mason-police dynamic. Despite stylistic differences, Chastain's effort is deemed a worthy addition.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

19	From Potter's Field	The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

Reviewers generally praise the first book, "The Reefs of Space," for its imaginative and detailed setting, featuring the Plan of Man, a super-computer controlling society. The novel's intriguing concepts, like The Body Bank and The Collar, fascinated readers, despite some unresolved plot points. "Starchild" maintains interest, particularly the exploration of the Plan of Man and the free societies on the Reefs, though it failed to capture the same intrigue as the first. "Rogue Star" is widely viewed as the weakest, criticized for abandoning interesting storylines in favor of less engaging narratives. While the trilogy isn't seen as a cohesive epic, it presents captivating ideas about human evolution and societal control. Overall, the writing quality diminishes with each book, but the series is still recommended, particularly for fans of classic science fiction.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Childress's adventurous spirit and narrative style make the book an enjoyable read for those open to speculative history, boasting wide coverage of unusual topics. However, the book receives criticism for its lack of scholarly rigor, typographical errors, and recycled content from his other works. Critics also find Childress's speculative theories, such as ancient advanced technologies and alien influences, implausible and lacking credible evidence.

22	Economics in one lesson	With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Economics+in+one+lesson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api	Currency	2010-08-11	{"Business & Economics"}	18	The user reviews offer varied feedback on "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt. Many appreciate the book's clear and concise explanation of fundamental economic principles, praising it as an accessible introduction to economics, particularly from a libertarian and free-market perspective. This positive feedback highlights the book's straightforward writing style and its effective use of real-world examples to illustrate economic concepts. \n\nHowever, some reviewers criticize the book for being overly simplistic and politically biased, with a strong inclination towards libertarian views and diminishing the complexity of economic realities. They argue that Hazlitt's arguments sometimes lack depth and fail to account for modern economic complexities, while others find the book less suitable for advanced readers seeking a comprehensive understanding of economics. Additionally, some reviewers note the outdated examples and context, given the book was originally published in the 1940s, which may limit its applicability to contemporary economic challenges. Despite these criticisms, the book is recommended for those interested in learning about free-market economics without delving into technical jargon.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

468	The Mystery of He	Meditate on the Spiritual Significance of Marriage In the 20th Anniversary Edition of this Gold Medallion Award winner, Mike Mason goes on a poetic search to understand the wondrous dynamics of committed love. In highly readable, first-person style, Mason's writing stimulates readers' thoughts and prayers and propels couples to deeper intimacy. "A marriage is not a joining of two worlds," says the author, "but an abandoning of two worlds in order that one new one might be formed." Rich chapters on "Otherness," "Vows," "Intimacy," "Sex," "Submission," and an all-new chapter on "Oneness" lift readers to view the eternal, spiritual nature of this faith-filled, "impossible," wild-yet wonderful-frontier. "The two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery." Ephesians 5:3132 Beautifully written and filled with life-transforming insights, the 20th anniversary edition of Mike Mason's unparalleled Gold Medallion winner explores the mystical and holy nature of marriage with a depth that will forever alter how a couple relates to each other-and to God. The Mystery of Marriage stands out from how-to manuals on marriage as a refreshing how-come book-a brilliant celebration of the God-ordained union between man and wife. "An outstanding achievement. Rarely has a book aroused in me so much enthusiasm as has the combination of wisdom, depth, dignity, and glow that I find in these chapters." -J.I. Packer "Absolutely exquisite. It reaches down deep into our innermost being, revealing, revitalizing, rewarding. A real classic." -Gigi Graham Tchividjian "A drop everything book. Mason deals with the stunning paradoxes of the mystery, the problems, and the glories of marriage. I don't need to read any other book on the subject." -Elisabeth Elliot Story Behind the Book Over the twenty years since its publication, many couples have told me that they've read my book aloud to each other. This always amazes me and gives me great joy. I'm also amazed that many single people have read it. Either way, my goal is for hearts to be warmed by the mystery of divine love. I want couples to enter into deeper intimacy by thinking together about the mystery of marriage -about how their love, besides being a gift of God, reflects the very love He has for Himself in the Trinity. For God is not a bachelor, and throughout the Bible marriage is a supreme picture of the nature of God's love and of His kingdom. I want people who read my book to feel so soaked in these wonderful, divine mysteries that it deepens their reverence for marriage and inspires them to greater love	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ec-R33X9UlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=ec-R33X9UlYC&dq=The+Mystery+of+He&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=ec-R33X9UlYC&dq=The+Mystery+of+He&hl=&source=gbs_api	Multnomah	2005-01-01	{"Family & Relationships"}	2	Michel Gagne's book has garnered praise for its unique approach, combining beautiful, surreal illustrations with a clever and imaginative story.

38	Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish	"I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary." So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, "Is there another way to lead a good life?" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts "spoke directly to me," writes Bender. Somehow, "they went straight to my heart." Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen "glows" and "no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday." In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her "crazy-quilt" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive "patches" of her own life. Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, Plain and Simple speaks to the seeker in each of us.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4axy2kGahCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=4axy2kGahCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Plain+And+Simple+-+A+Woman%27s+Journey+To+The+Amish&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4axy2kGahCEC&source=gbs_api	Harper Collins	2009-03-17	{Religion}	11	"Plain and Simple" by Sue Bender is a reflective exploration of her journey to understand the Amish lifestyle.

The book is a concise, accessible survey intertwining historical records with prophetic messages to depict ancient Jewish life. While well-received for its clarity and brevity, it subtly suggests that readers might benefit more from reading the Bible directly for a comprehensive understanding of ancient Israel’s history.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

49	Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)	Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api	Library of America	1995-03-01	{History}	8	This collection of Thomas Paine's writings, including "Common Sense," "The American Crisis," and "The Age of Reason," displays his influence on American independence and social thought. Reviewers praise Paine's ability to communicate complex ideas with clarity, inspire through moral passion, and challenge social norms, such as slavery and religious orthodoxy. However, some find his arguments in "The Age of Reason" offensive, as he critiques organized religion and the Bible. The book is admired for its historical significance and high-quality production. Critics acknowledge Paine's importance yet note his lack of formal education and occasional logical fallacies in his reasoning. Overall, the collection is deemed essential for understanding America's foundations.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Written with Winchester’s captivating style and breadth, here are conversations and anecdotes, myths and political analysis, scenery and history—a poignant and colorful record of the lingering beat of what was once the heart of the civilized world.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M_L7MyV44rUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=M_L7MyV44rUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Outposts&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M_L7MyV44rUC&source=gbs_api	Harper Collins	2009-10-27	{History}	7	Simon Winchester's "Outposts" explores the remnants of the British Empire through a travelogue that blends history, geography, and personal anecdotes.

64	Sweet Dream Baby	Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life. Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future.

Dr. Bernstein’s approach, grounded in his personal experience as a diabetic and medical doctor, is praised for its practical advice and comprehensive coverage of diabetes management.

Despite these criticisms, the consensus is that the book is a valuable resource for anyone looking to better manage their diabetes.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

The author weaves insights from various figures to create a mystical narrative that resonates with those seeking unity and spiritual depth. Positive feedback highlights the brilliant integration of Sufi elements, accessible introductions to Jungian psychology, and an overall mystical and refreshing perspective. However, critics point to the scattered presentation of Sufism, excessive dream material, and limited context for dream interpretations as downsides.

83	The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft	'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Triumph+of+the+Moon:+A+History+of+Modern+Pagan+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Oxford University Press	2019-10-10	{"Body, Mind & Spirit"}	6	"Triumph of the Moon" by Ronald Hutton receives acclaim for its comprehensive and scholarly examination of the history and evolution of modern Wicca and neo-Paganism. Positively, reviewers highlight Hutton's thorough research, academic rigor, and non-judgmental approach to dissecting Wicca's roots, noting its well-documented origins in 19th and 20th-century Romanticism, literature, and secret societies like Freemasonry. The book is recognized for challenging myths about Wicca's ancient origins while validating the religion's modern significance. Negatively, some criticize the dense writing, the paperback's small font, and feel Hutton's focus on British Wicca limits a broader understanding of neo-Paganism. Despite this, it's deemed essential reading for those exploring Paganism's historical and cultural development.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

87	Labor's untold story,	"Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers." -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&q=Labor%27s+untold+story,&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&source=gbs_api	United Electrical Radio &	1975-01-01	{"Business & Economics"}	2	"Labor's Untold Story" by Richard O. Boyer and Herbert Morais is a compelling and vivid account of the American labor movement from its inception to the mid-1950s. The book is celebrated for narrating history from the perspective of the working class, uncovering stories often omitted from traditional history books. It highlights significant labor events, figures, and movements, such as the Knights of Labor, the Wobblies, and figures like Eugene V. Debs. While praised for its engaging narrative and detailed accounts, critics argue it's biased, overly sympathetic to labor, and lacks balance, dismissing other interpretations of historical controversy.

For thirteen months Point Pleasant was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic 'Bird' - the Mothman.

91	Beauty & Submission	"This book is as seductive as the phenomenon that it explores. With courage, love, and joy, Frueh crosses into unexplored terrains of beauty and pleasure, where she finds a grotesquely captivating creature: Monster/Beauty. By illuminating her journey with thoughtful insight and engaging prose, she encourages readers to join her in her quest to articulate fresh ways of thinking about the aesthetic and the erotic and of theorizing the flux of lived experience." —John Alan Farmer, senior editor of Art Journal "Monster/Beauty is a daringly provocative experiment in personal and erotic writing and an important book for anyone interested in breaking normative codes of beauty, pedagogy, and authorial methodology. In a richly self-revealing text, Frueh proposes nothing less than a Rabellaisian re-ordering of aesthetic embodiments within social relations." —Mira Schor, author of Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture "Giving new meaning to "embodied writing," this book goes farther than any other toward getting the body into the text. Joanna Frueh is a performance artist first-she is also an art historian, a singer, a poet, a bodybuilder, a professor, an academic celebrity of modest fame, but her performances collapse these distinctions. Frueh's intensely personal, intensely physical prose brings an aura of presence to the book that rivals the effect she achieves on stage." —Robyn Warhol, co-editor of Feminisms "This book is monstrous--full of gorgeous hypermuscular women, step-mothers, and vampires; full of ravishing muscular sex, classroom erotics, splendid aging. It is a performance in which Frueh explores and celebrates her body, its powers and beauties, and those of her friends and lovers." —Alphonso Lingis, author of Excesses, Abuses, and Dangerous Emotions "A welcome voice in contemporary feminist theory, Frueh's Monster/Beauty reminds us of the pleasures of thinking, teaching and creating in wholly embodied, sensual and passionate acts. Frueh poetically enacts the self as an aesthetic/erotic project, affirming the many different and beautiful selves we can become. It is a joy to read." —Marsha Meskimmon, author of We Weren't Modern Enough: Women Artists and the Limits of German Modernism "Joanna Frueh is a hero.

The book introduces Jacobsen's theory of "Evolutionary Intelligence" and offers self-assessment tools to help gifted adults understand themselves. Positive feedback highlights the book as enlightening and validating, offering a sense of relief to those who feel different. Criticisms include its repetitiveness, lack of practical advice, and perceived elitism. Some readers feel it could benefit from more concrete strategies for applying insights into everyday life and cite a need for additional academic references. Despite these drawbacks, many regard it as an essential read for gifted individuals and those around them.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

It stood as the sole source of relevant information until recent scholarship emerged. Known for its detailed exploration of arms, armor, and fighting styles of Germanic tribes from 400-800 A.D., the text, complemented by the author's illustrations, appeals to both young readers and adults.

97	In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age	The information revolution--which is as much an organizational as a technological revolution--is transforming the nature of conflict across the spectrum: from open warfare, to terrorism, crime, and even radical social activism. The era of massed field armies is passing, because the new information and communications systems are increasing the lethality of quite small units that can call in deadly, precise missile fire almost anywhere, anytime. In social conflicts, the Internet and other media are greatly empowering individuals and small groups to influence the behavior of states. Whether in military or social conflicts, all protagonists will soon be developing new doctrines, strategies, and tactics for swarming their opponents--with weapons or words, as circumstances require. Preparing for conflict in such a world will require shifting to new forms of organization, particularly the versatile, hardy, all-channel network. This shift will prove difficult for states and professional militaries that remain bastions of hierarchy, bound to resist institutional redesign. They will make the shift as they realize that information and knowledge are becoming the key elements of power. This implies, among other things, that Mars, the old brute-force god of war, must give way to Athena, the well-armed goddess of wisdom. Accepting Athena as the patroness of this information age represents a first step not only for preparing for future conflicts, but also for preventing them.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+Athena%27s+Camp:+Preparing+for+Conflict+in+the+Information+Age&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qJGawYmm6b4C&source=gbs_api	Rand Corporation	1997-10-07	{Computers}	1	"In Athena's Camp" is a book that explores international cyber threats faced by nations and companies, providing a theoretical framework suited for strategic thinkers in security policy. It combines historical military perspectives with modern cyberwarfare analysis, illustrating past conflicts to inform future strategies. While praised for its high-level insight and relevance, especially in political science, the book lacks technical details and specific solutions, which disappoints IT professionals seeking concrete guidance. Critics note its dense content and overuse of the term "cyber." The absence of a proper index and focus on major cyber actors like China and Russia further limit its utility.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

100	The Fire Next Time	A national bestseller when it first appeared in 1963, The Fire Next Time galvanized the nation, gave passionate voice to the emerging civil rights movement—and still lights the way to understanding race in America today. "Basically the finest essay I’ve ever read. . . . Baldwin refused to hold anyone’s hand. He was both direct and beautiful all at once. He did not seem to write to convince you. He wrote beyond you.” —Ta-Nehisi Coates At once a powerful evocation of James Baldwin's early life in Harlem and a disturbing examination of the consequences of racial injustice, the book is an intensely personal and provocative document from the iconic author of If Beale Street Could Talk and Go Tell It on the Mountain. It consists of two "letters," written on the occasion of the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, that exhort Americans, both black and white, to attack the terrible legacy of racism. Described by The New York Times Book Review as "sermon, ultimatum, confession, deposition, testament, and chronicle...all presented in searing, brilliant prose," The Fire Next Time stands as a classic of literature.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ctWAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=7ctWAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Fire+Next+Time&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=7ctWAAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Fire+Next+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api	Vintage	2013-09-17	{"Political Science"}	2	James Baldwin's "The Fire Next Time" is widely praised for its eloquent and incisive exploration of race relations, religion, and social justice in 1960s America. Baldwin's narrative is recognized for its emotional intensity and depth, providing both a personal and societal critique. The book, which consists of two essays, discusses Baldwin's rejection of Christianity and his insights from a meeting with Elijah Muhammad of the Nation of Islam. Positive feedback highlights Baldwin's masterful prose and his ability to articulate complex ideas about race, identity, and justice. Critics of the book note a dislike for Baldwin's comma-heavy and complex writing style. Overall, the book is seen as a powerful and enduring work that challenges readers to confront racial and social issues directly.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
101	The Book of Love Laughter & Romance	Rowdy, ecstatic, and sometimes stern, these teaching stories and fables reveal new and very human properties in Rumi's vision. Included here are the notorious “Latin parts” that Reynold Nicholson felt were too unseemly to appear in English in his 1920s translation. For Rumi, anything that human beings do—however compulsive—affords a glimpse into the inner life. Here are more than 40 fables or teaching stories that deal with love, laughter, death, betrayal, and the soul. The stories are exuberant, earthy, and bursting with vitality—much like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch or Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The characters are guilty, lecherous, tricky, ribald, and finally possessors of opened souls. Barks writes: "These teaching stories are a kind of scrimshaw—intricately carved, busy figures, confused and threatening, and weirdly funny. This is an entertaining collection from one of the greatest spiritual poets of all time, rendered by his most popular translator. “The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.”--Rumi	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=65veDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=65veDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Book+of+Love+Laughter&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=65veDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Hampton Roads Publishing	2016-10-01	{Religion}	2	"Tales of others in romantic situations provide a feel-good experience for readers interested in happy couples.

The book is praised for its vivid storytelling, cultural insights, and exploration of rural Japanese life, contrasting Japanese educational discipline with American creativity. While some readers found it informative and entertaining, others felt it contained condescending tones, outdated observations, and lacked deeper understanding of Japanese culture. Despite criticisms of arrogant writing and clichés, it remains recommended for those interested in cross-cultural experiences and Japan's school system.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

105	A Time in Rome	Elizabeth Bowen's account of a time spent in Rome is no ordinary guidebook but an evocation of a city - its history, its architecture and, above all, its atmosphere. She describes the famous classical sites, conjuring from the ruins visions of former inhabitants and their often bloody activities and speculates about the immense noise of ancient Rome, the problems caused by the Romans' dining posture, and the Roman temperament. She evokes the city's moods - by day, when it is characterised by golden sunlight, and at night, when the blaze of the moon 'annihilates history'.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D5i3CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=D5i3CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Time+in+Rome&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D5i3CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Random House	2015-06-11	{Travel}	1	Elizabeth Bowen's evocative writing beautifully captures the setting, offering readers a delightful experience.

107	Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary	This book offers a conceptual overview of documentary filmmaking practice. It addresses numerous social issues and how they are presented to the viewer by means of style, rhetoric, and narrative technique. The volume poses questions about the relationship of the documentary tradition to power, the body, authority, knowledge, and our experience of history. This study advances the pioneering work of Nichols's earlier book, Ideology and the Image. The rigorous discussion of modes of documentary representation, the relationship between narrative and nonfiction, and the representation of the body (including a chapter on pornography, ethnography, and power), give this book enormous value for the study of visual anthropology and ethnographic film. The often neglected relationship between signifier and referent is the special focus of this intensive study of documentary film. The concluding discussion of the representation of the body will also be of special interest to semioticians.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Representing+Reality:+Issues+and+Concepts+in+Documentary&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jq2cS7qARd8C&dq=Representing+Reality:+Issues+and+Concepts+in+Documentary&hl=&source=gbs_api	Indiana University Press	1991-01-01	{"Performing Arts"}	3	The book "Representing Reality" by Bill Nichols offers insightful discussions on documentary film, exploring ethics, documentary style, and the concept of reality. It raises important questions and provides food for thought about the nature of documentaries. However, readers find the prose challenging, describing it as clumsy and muddled, making the book difficult to navigate compared to more accessible alternatives like Erik Barnouw's work. Nichols's use of complex jargon ("situatedness," "reconceptualization") is criticized for obscuring rather than clarifying ideas. While some appreciate its theoretical depth, others find it fraught with simplistic, underdeveloped concepts buried in verbose language.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

111	Language and Symbolic Power	This volume brings together Pierre Bourdieu's highly original writings on language and on the relations among language, power, and politics. Bourdieu develops a forceful critique of traditional approaches to language, including the linguistic theories of Saussure and Chomsky and the theory of speech-acts elaborated by Austin and others. He argues that language should be viewed not only as a means of communication but also as a medium of power through which individuals pursue their own interests and display their practical competence. Drawing on the concepts that are part of his distinctive theoretical approach, Bourdieu maintains that linguistic utterances or expressions can be understood as the product of the relation between a "linguistic market" and a "linguistic habitus." When individuals use language in particular ways, they deploy their accumulated linguistic resources and implicitly adapt their words to the demands of the social field or market that is their audience. Hence every linguistic interaction, however personal or insignificant it may seem, bears the traces of the social structure that it both expresses and helps to reproduce. Bourdieu's account sheds fresh light on the ways in which linguistic usage varies according to considerations such as class and gender. It also opens up a new approach to the ways in which language is used in the domain of politics. For politics is, among other things, the arena in which words are deeds and the symbolic character of power is at stake. This volume, by one of the leading social thinkers in the world today, represents a major contribution to the study of language and power. It will be of interest to students throughout the social sciences and humanities, especially in sociology, politics, anthropology, linguistics, and literature.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Language+and+Symbolic+Power&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=u2ZlGBiJntAC&dq=Language+and+Symbolic+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api	Harvard University Press	1991-01-01	{"Language Arts & Disciplines"}	3	The book receives mixed feedback from reviewers. On the negative side, it's seen as difficult for US linguistics students to apply Bourdieu's abstract concepts, like symbolic and economic capital, to the actual production of speech, as he doesn't focus on linguistic details. However, a positive aspect highlighted is Bourdieu's ability to connect language use with broader social contexts, offering valuable insights into social power dynamics and exclusion within dialects. His chapter on Searle is particularly praised for clarity and insight on the social power of speech acts. Fans of Bourdieu's work find the book captivating and highly recommend it, especially for symbolic interactionists and conflict theorists.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

You can learn true Latin, with conjugations, declensions, and all those extra syllables – and it’s easier than you think. In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations. Easy-to-understand sections describe: Latin you already know Grammar Pronunciation Latin in action Latin in law Latin in medicine Latin for impressing your friends And much more No dusty tome or other such artifact, Latin For Dummies makes learning fun and brings the language to life by presenting conversations in various Roman settings, as well as providing fun facts and stories about classical life. And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

However, they face challenges due to the lack of comprehensive resources for practical vocabulary. A new book addresses this need by providing vocabulary for everyday situations in 25 accessible chapters, making it a useful, affordable supplement. While the Latin quality is decent, some adjustments may be needed, but this is a matter of personal preference. Although not a substitute for formal textbooks, the book effectively supports Latin as both a communicative and reading language, enhancing student engagement and expression.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Have you ever felt as if your tasks––whether in a big organization or at home––just didn’t really contribute to anything significant?

124	Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror	In this brilliant look at the rise of political Islam, the distinguished political scientist and anthropologist Mahmood Mamdani brings his expertise and insight to bear on a question many Americans have been asking since 9/11: how did this happen? Mamdani dispels the idea of “good” (secular, westernized) and “bad” (premodern, fanatical) Muslims, pointing out that these judgments refer to political rather than cultural or religious identities. The presumption that there are “good” Muslims readily available to be split off from “bad” Muslims masks a failure to make a political analysis of our times. This book argues that political Islam emerged as the result of a modern encounter with Western power, and that the terrorist movement at the center of Islamist politics is an even more recent phenomenon, one that followed America’s embrace of proxy war after its defeat in Vietnam. Mamdani writes with great insight about the Reagan years, showing America’s embrace of the highly ideological politics of “good” against “evil.” Identifying militant nationalist governments as Soviet proxies in countries such as Nicaragua and Afghanistan, the Reagan administration readily backed terrorist movements, hailing them as the “moral equivalents” of America’s Founding Fathers. The era of proxy wars has come to an end with the invasion of Iraq. And there, as in Vietnam, America will need to recognize that it is not fighting terrorism but nationalism, a battle that cannot be won by occupation. Good Muslim, Bad Muslim is a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world today.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Good+Muslim,+Bad+Muslim:+America,+the+Cold+War,+and+the+Roots+of+Terror&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W69rBkP3W7QC&source=gbs_api	Harmony	2005-06-21	{Religion}	4	"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror" by Mahmood Mamdani has received mixed reviews from readers. Positively, Mamdani is praised for his intellectual depth and scholarly insight into the historical context surrounding U.S. foreign policy and its role in fostering political Islam. Some readers found his analysis on U.S. involvement in proxy wars during the Cold War, particularly in Afghanistan, thorough and eye-opening. However, the book has been criticized for its perceived bias against the U.S., with some arguing that Mamdani places excessive blame on American actions while downplaying internal factors within Muslim societies. Additionally, the writing style, particularly the structure of references and early chapters, is seen as dense and challenging, hindering accessibility for some readers. Overall, the book is recognized for sparking important discourse but is critiqued for its one-sided perspective and organizational issues.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

141	Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft	Tormented girls writhing in agony, stern judges meting out harsh verdicts, nineteen bodies swinging on Gallows Hill. The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which climaxed in the Salem witch trials From rich and varied sources—many neglected and unknown—Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum give us a picture of the people and events more intricate and more fascinating than any other in the massive literature. It is a story of powerful and deeply divided families and of a community determined to establish an independent identity—beset by restraints and opposition from without and factional conflicts from within—and a minister whose obsessions helped to bring this volatile mix to the flash point. Not simply a dramatic and isolated event, the Salem outbreak has wider implications for our understanding of developments central to the American experience: the disintegration of Puritanism, the pressures of land and population in New England towns, the problems besetting farmer and householder, the shifting role of the church, and the powerful impact of commercial capitalism.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Salem+Possessed,+The+Social+Origins+of+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FIRtMQabjJ4C&source=gbs_api	Harvard University Press	1976-01-01	{History}	4	"Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft" by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum offers a unique analysis of the Salem Witch Trials by examining the socio-economic and political tensions in Salem Village.

The authors are praised for their meticulous exploration of the relationships between key families and their roles. However, some criticize the book's heavy focus on sociological explanations at the expense of psychological and gender considerations and notably question its conclusions regarding capitalism. Despite differing opinions, the book is widely recommended, particularly for readers interested in history and sociology, as its detailed account challenges prevailing myths and assumptions about the infamous events of 1692.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

145	Science of the Gods	A paradigm-shifting blend of science, religion, and philosophy for agnostic, spiritual-but-not-religious, and scientifically minded readers Many people are fed up with the way traditional religion alienates them: too easily it can perpetuate conflict, vilify science, and undermine reason. Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, “Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name ‘God?’” In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science—but that this doesn’t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name “God” in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals’ choices, God, she argues, is an “emergent phenomenon” that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity’s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe—it created the meaning of the universe. It’s not universal—it’s planetary. It can’t change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Science+of+the+Gods&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQVoBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Beacon Press	2015-03-10	{Religion}	13	"Science of the Gods" by David Ash and Peter Hewitt is an accessible introduction to quantum physics for beginners.

The book raises important normative and ethical issues, making it valuable for advanced studies in political behavior. Critics cite its dense statistical content and lack of focus on core values and partisanship as drawbacks.

148	The Great Divide: The Rocky Mountains in the American Mind	More than any other American landscape, the Rocky Mountains have prompted a remarkable medley of fierce, poetic dreams. For some 150 years this region served as a landscape of freedom for the black sheep of our culture: from the rebellious sons of wealthy industrialists to African American trappers; from affluent young women struggling for suffrage to the hippies of the 1960s, determined to turn their backs on the establishment. Gary Ferguson spins magnificent tales about these vivid charactersblazing a trail that leads us finally to modern adventure travelers bedecked in high-tech outerwear and toting satellite phones into the wild. From this spot on the crest of the continent comes a fresh look at how the nation's wild lands inspired some of our most cherished notions of freedom, as well as how much we stand to lose should our connections to those lands drift out of reach. 25 black & white photos, index.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=trvXVsaDG7gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=trvXVsaDG7gC&dq=The+Great+Divide:+The+Rocky+Mountains+in+the+American+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=trvXVsaDG7gC&dq=The+Great+Divide:+The+Rocky+Mountains+in+the+American+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api	W.

While praised for its breadth and engaging narrative, some readers found it lacked depth and coherence, with a focus more on anecdotal evidence than systematic analysis. The book covers a range of characters and settings, mainly in the 19th century, but ventures post-World War II only briefly.

151	The life of David	Part of the Jewish Encounter series Poet, warrior, and king, David has loomed large in myth and legend through the centuries, and he continues to haunt our collective imagination, his flaws and inconsistencies making him the most approachable of biblical heroes. Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate of the United States, plumbs the depths of David’s life: his triumphs and his failures, his charm and his cruelty, his divine destiny and his human humiliations. Drawing on the biblical chronicle of David’s life as well as on the later commentaries and the Psalms—traditionally considered to be David’s own words—Pinsky teases apart the many strands of David’s story and reweaves them into a glorious narrative. Under the clarifying and captivating light of Pinsky’s erudition and imagination, and his mastery of image and expression, King David—both the man and the idea of the man—is brought brilliantly to life.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WGvqiDGSRS0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=WGvqiDGSRS0C&pg=PA152&dq=The+life+of+David&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WGvqiDGSRS0C&source=gbs_api	Schocken	2005-09-06	{"Biography & Autobiography"}	1	A.W.

152	Fire and Ice: Two Deadly Disasters (Fire at Peshtigo; Shipwreck on Lake Michigan)	“Lighthouses are a reflection of the human spirit and a mirror to our past.”—from the Introduction No symbol is more synonymous with Wisconsin’s rich maritime traditions than the lighthouse. These historic beacons conjure myriad notions of a bygone era: romance, loneliness, and dependability; dedicated keepers manning the lights; eerie tales of haunted structures and ghosts of past keepers; mariners of yesteryear anxiously hoping to make safe haven around rocky shorelines. If these sentinels could talk, imagine the tales they would tell of ferocious Great Lakes storms taking their toll on vessels and people alike. In this fully updated edition of Wisconsin Lighthouses, Ken and Barb Wardius tell those tales, taking readers on an intimate tour of lighthouses on Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Winnebago. Both delightful storytellers and accomplished photographers, the couple complement their engaging text with more than 100 stunning color photographs, along with dozens of archival photos, maps, documents, and artifacts.

154	Crucial Confrontations	The authors of the New York Times bestseller Crucial Conversations show you how to achieve personal, team, and organizational success by healing broken promises, resolving violated expectations, and influencing good behavior Discover skills to resolve touchy, controversial, and complex issues at work and at home--now available in this follow-up to the internationally popular Crucial Conversations. Behind the problems that routinely plague organizations and families, you'll find individuals who are either unwilling or unable to deal with failed promises. Others have broken rules, missed deadlines, failed to live up to commitments, or just plain behaved badly--and nobody steps up to the issue. Or they do, but do a lousy job and create a whole new set of problems. Accountability suffers and new problems spring up. New research demonstrates that these disappointments aren't just irritating, they're costly--sapping organizational performance by twenty to fifty percent and accounting for up to ninety percent of divorces. Crucial Confrontations teaches skills drawn from 10,000 hours of real-life observations to increase confidence in facing issues like: An employee speaks to you in an insulting tone that crosses the line between sarcasm and insubordination. Now what? Your boss just committed you to a deadline you know you can't meet--and not-so-subtly hinted he doesn't want to hear complaints about it. Your son walks through the door sporting colorful new body art that raises your blood pressure by forty points. Speak now, pay later. An accountant wonders how to step up to a client who is violating the law. Can you spell unemployment? Family members fret over how to tell granddad that he should no longer drive his car. This is going to get ugly. A nurse worries about what to say to an abusive physician. She quickly remembers "how things work around here" and decides not to say anything. Everyone knows how to run for cover, or if adequately provoked, step up to these confrontations in a way that causes a real ruckus. That we have down pat. Crucial Confrontations teaches you how to deal with violated expectations in a way that solves the problem at hand, and doesn't harm the relationship--and in fact, even strengthens it. Crucial Confrontations borrows from twenty years of research involving two groups. More than 25,000 people helped the authors identify those who were most influential during crucial confrontations. They spent 10,000 hours watching these people, documented what they saw, and then trained and tested with more than 300,000 people. Second, they measured the impact of crucial confrontations improvements on organizational and team performance--the results were immediate and sustainable: twenty to fifty percent improvements in measurable performance.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I1oOcpvsmOkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=I1oOcpvsmOkC&q=Crucial+Confrontations&dq=Crucial+Confrontations&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=I1oOcpvsmOkC&dq=Crucial+Confrontations&hl=&source=gbs_api	McGraw Hill Professional	2004-08-26	{"Business & Economics"}	4	"Crucial Confrontations," a follow-up to "Crucial Conversations," is praised for providing practical tools and insights into handling critical confrontations effectively in both personal and professional settings.

155	The interpretation of dreams	“The interpretation of dreams is the via regia to a knowledge of the unconscious element in our physical life.”—Sigmund Freud Freud’s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. Through them the inhibitions are released and tensions relaxed. The ability to interpret these manifestations of conflict in the human psyche opened a vast new realm of investigation, particularly invaluable in the treatment of neuroses. By his pioneer investigations into the world of dreams, Sigmund Freud created a transformation in our generation’s thinking. The Interpretation of Dreams is offered here in the translation by Dr. A. A. Brill, who for almost forty years was the translator and standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k1h-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=k1h-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+interpretation+of+dreams&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k1h-AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Modern Library	2014-01-22	{Psychology}	375	The collection of reviews on Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" presents varied opinions.

Some reviewers find the book's length, dense writing, and outdated examples challenging, with Freud's emphasis on sexuality being criticized as overemphasized. Others remark on the book's structural issues, particularly in newer publications lacking proper translations and organizational features.

160	How to Write and Speak Correctly	In the preparation of this little work the writer has kept one end in view.: To make it serviceable for those for whom it is intended, that is, for those who have neither the time nor the opportunity, the learning nor the inclination, to peruse elaborate and abstruse treatises on Rhetoric, Grammar, and Composition. To them such works are as gold enclosed in chests of steel and locked beyond power of opening. This book has no pretension about it whatever,-it is neither a Manual of Rhetoric, expatiating on the dogmas of style, nor a Grammar full of arbitrary rules and exceptions. It is merely an effort to help ordinary, everyday people to express themselves in ordinary, everyday language, in a proper manner. Some broad rules are laid down, the observance of which will enable the reader to keep within the pale of propriety in oral and written language. Many idiomatic words and expressions, peculiar to the language, have been given, besides which a number of the common mistakes and pitfalls have been placed before the reader so that he may know and avoid them.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-951DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=-951DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+to+Write+and+Speak+Correctly&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-951DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	BoD – Books on Demand	2018-11-01	{"Language Arts & Disciplines"}	2	The book on grammar and language usage has received mixed reviews from readers. \n\n**Positive Feedback:**\nThe book is praised for being educational, concise, and a useful resource for brushing up on English grammar, especially for those learning English as a second language.

164	Walt Whitman: Selected Poems 1855-1892	A fully unexpurgated collection that restores the sexual vitality and subversive flair suppressed by Whitman himself in later editions of Leaves of Grass. A century after his death, Whitman is still celebrated as America's greatest poet. In this startling new edition of his work, Whitman biographer Gary Schmidgall presents over 200 poems in their original pristine form, in the chronological order in which they were written, with Whitman's original punctuation. Included in this volume are facsimiles of Whitman's original manuscripts, contemporary - and generally blistering - reviews of Whitman's poetry (not surprisingly Henry James hated it), and early pre-Leaves of Grass poems that return us to the physical Whitman, rejoicing - sometimes graphically - in homoerotic love. Unlike the many other available editions, all drawn from the final authorized or "deathbed" Leaves of Grass, this collection focuses on the exuberant poems Whitman wrote during the creative and sexual prime of his life, roughly between l853 and l860. These poems are faithfully presented as Whitman first gave them to the world - fearless, explicit and uncompromised - before he transformed himself into America's respectable, mainstream Good Gray Poet through 30 years of revision, self-censorship and suppression. Whitman admitted that his later poetry lacked the "ecstasy of statement" of his early verse. Revealing that ecstasy for the first time, this edition makes possible a major reappraisal of our nation first great poet.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EYLWAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=EYLWAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Walt+Whitman:+Selected+Poems+1855-1892&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYLWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	St. Martin's Press	2013-10-08	{Poetry}	4	This collection of Walt Whitman's poetry, edited by Gary Schmidgall, offers a version of "Leaves of Grass" that restores the original vigor and boldness of Whitman's early work. The reviews commend this edition for presenting poems in their initial forms, which capture the raw creativity and controversial themes often toned down in later revisions. Readers praise the inclusion of historical context, such as letters, reviews, and notes, providing insight into Whitman's creative process. While some find the paperback cover lacking, the content is lauded for its authenticity and emotional depth, offering a more genuine appreciation of Whitman's artistic genius.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
165	In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy	"What is the spell for?" Miranda asked curiously, stepping close beside him to squeeze through the first ring of trees. She didn't know of any goblin spells that used flowers unless they were crushed like herbs. "Do you really want to know?" murmured the elf absently, looking up at the dark crowns of the ancient oaks. "Yes," she said. She had always liked magic. He glanced back down at her then. "It's for you," he said. And the instant they passed the great trunks, his hand closed over her wrist. The powerful final volume of the Hollow Kingdom Trilogy Miranda has waited her whole life to come home to the goblin kingdom, but she never imagined she'd feel so alone there. Her beloved Marak, the center of her world since childhood, has reached the end of his reign. But Marak didn't raise a coward.

Criticisms included perceived anti-feminist themes, reliance on romance over fantasy, and insufficient character connections.

183	ORDINARY JUSTICE.	"A groundbreaking book . . . revealing the systemic, everyday problems in our courts that must be addressed if justice is truly to be served."—Doris Kearns Goodwin Attorney and journalist Amy Bach spent eight years investigating the widespread courtroom failures that each day upend lives across America. What she found was an assembly-line approach to justice: a system that rewards mediocre advocacy, bypasses due process, and shortchanges both defendants and victims to keep the court calendar moving. Here is the public defender who pleads most of his clients guilty with scant knowledge about their circumstances; the judge who sets outrageous bail for negligible crimes; the prosecutor who habitually declines to pursue significant cases; the court that works together to achieve a wrongful conviction. Going beyond the usual explanations of bad apples and meager funding, Ordinary Injustice reveals a clubby legal culture of compromise, and shows the tragic consequences that result when communities mistake the rules that lawyers play by for the rule of law. It is time, Bach argues, to institute a new method of checks and balances that will make injustice visible—the first and necessary step to reform.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TGcxvQRT5swC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=TGcxvQRT5swC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ORDINARY+JUSTICE.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TGcxvQRT5swC&source=gbs_api	Metropolitan Books	2010-08-03	{"Political Science"}	5	"Ordinary Justice" by Trudy Labovitz is a captivating mystery set in West Virginia, featuring Zoe Gergulin, a former Justice Department employee haunted by her past.

172	Dispatches from the Front: Theological Engagements with the Secular	God knows it is hard to make God boring, Stanley Hauerwas writes, but American Christians, aided and abetted by theologians, have accomplished that feat. Whatever might be said about Hauerwas—and there is plenty—no one has ever accused him of being boring, and in this book he delivers another jolt to all those who think that Christian theology is a matter of indifference to our secular society. At once Christian theology and social criticism, this book aims to show that the two cannot be separated. In this spirit, Hauerwas mounts a forceful attack on current sentimentalities about the significance of democracy, the importance of the family, and compassion, which appears here as a literally fatal virtue. In this time of the decline of religious knowledge, when knowing a little about a religion tends to do more harm than good, Hauerwas offers direction to those who would make Christian discourse both useful and truthful. Animated by a deep commitment, his essays exhibit the difference that Christian theology can make in the shaping of lives and the world.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SzXPYR0ym8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=SzXPYR0ym8AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dispatches+from+the+Front:+Theological+Engagements+with+the+Secular&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=SzXPYR0ym8AC&dq=Dispatches+from+the+Front:+Theological+Engagements+with+the+Secular&hl=&source=gbs_api	Duke University Press	1995-01-01	{Religion}	1	Stanley Hauerwas is praised for his provocative and challenging views that disrupt conventional Christianity, similar to the likes of Will D. Campbell and Clarence Jordan. His essays, such as those proposing that gays are morally superior to Christians, are highlighted as brilliant yet potentially unsettling. Hauerwas is commended for advocating for the mentally handicapped, urging society to learn from and serve them better. His writing is described as thought-provoking, engaging with complex theological figures like Karl Barth and William Stringfellow, and redefining what it means to be a Christian in America.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

175	Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy	On May 10, 1996, Lene Gammelgaard became the first Scandinavian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. But a raging storm and human error conspired to turn triumph into catastrophe. Eight of her team's climbers, including its renowned leader Scott Fischer, perished in a tragedy that would make headlines around the world. In her riveting account, Gammelgaard takes us from her weeks of determined training to the exhilaration of arriving in Nepal to the arduous climb and deadly storm that forced her and her fellow climbers to huddle throughout the night, hoping to stay alive. Gammelgaard also writes movingly of Everest's awesome beauty; of the passion and commitment required to face the daunting challenge of climbing to high altitudes; and of the complex personal relationships forged in the pursuit of such dangerous ventures. Arlene Blum, author of the classic account of women and mountaineering, Annapurna: A Woman's Place, calls Climbing High "an honest and deeply personal account."	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OyYET6wHSacC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=OyYET6wHSacC&dq=Climbing+High:+A+Woman%27s+Account+of+Surviving+the+Everest+Tragedy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=OyYET6wHSacC&dq=Climbing+High:+A+Woman%27s+Account+of+Surviving+the+Everest+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api	Harper Collins	2000-06-20	{"Sports & Recreation"}	4	Lene Gammelgaard's "Climbing High" offers a personal account of the 1996 Everest tragedy, employing a disjointed, journal-like style with new age philosophical reflections, which some readers find off-putting. While the book provides a unique female perspective and explores Gammelgaard's personal journey and emotions during the climb, it lacks detailed analysis or new insights into the disaster compared to works like Krakauer’s "Into Thin Air." Critics highlight its self-centered nature and question the author's climbing expertise, whereas others appreciate its emotional depth. The book’s merit lies in its personal narrative, particularly for those interested in Gammelgaard’s personal experience rather than a comprehensive account of the tragedy.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

The church is the new community of God's people. It's filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. And it has as much to say to the world today as it did two thousand years ago. In Acts, you will discover that God wants to do a fresh work among his people by the power of the Holy Spirit. You will find the pathway to authentic community. You will learn how to grow as a worshiper. And you will deepen your passion to invite others into the fellowship of Christ-followers we call the church. Sound exciting? Let's rediscover church together!	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y2mTq5BH5l8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=y2mTq5BH5l8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Acts:+Build+Community&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=y2mTq5BH5l8C&dq=Acts:+Build+Community&hl=&source=gbs_api	Zondervan	1999-09-28	{Religion}	1	John Ortberg's study, while not fully comprehensive on the Book of Acts, offers valuable insights into specific sections, sparking meaningful conversations and personal growth.

178	INFRARED DETECTORS & SYSTEMS	Infrared Detectors and Systems offers a deep and detailed examination of the optical detection process and the electronics of mimicking the eye. It further explores recent research in new detector materials and the latest advances in optical detectors. This text covers the range of subjects necessary for the understanding of modern infrared-imaging systems at a level appropriate for seniors or first-year graduate students in physics or electrical engineering. The first six chapters focus on fundamental background issues of radiation detection, beginning with the basics of geometrical optics and finishing with a discussion of the figures of merit used for describing the signal-to-noise performance of a detector system. Other topics include radiometry and flux-transfer issues, basic radiation-detector mechanisms, and random-process mathematics. The book concludes with a close look at infrared detection systems and related issues. In the discussion of infrared search systems, the range equation is developed in terms of the optical and detector parameters of the system. A separate chapter is devoted to modulation transfer function, a spatial-frequency-domain description of image quality. The final chapter describes the design equations for thermal-imager systems in terms of noise-equivalent temperature difference and minimum resolvable temperature. Supported and clarified by 470 illustrations and accompanied by an extensive glossary of the nomenclature, this is an excellent text for graduate and senior level courses in radiometry and infrared detectors. It is also a valuable reference for practicing engineers involved in the use, design, analysis, and testing of infrared detector-based systems.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AvtRAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=AvtRAAAAMAAJ&q=INFRARED+DETECTORS&dq=INFRARED+DETECTORS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=AvtRAAAAMAAJ&dq=INFRARED+DETECTORS&hl=&source=gbs_api	Wiley-Interscience	1996-01-01	{"Technology & Engineering"}	1	The book is well-regarded for its in-depth discussions on topics like radiometry, NEP, and detector noise, providing sufficient detail that eliminates the need for additional references.

On the positive side, Nietzsche's bold and thought-provoking critiques, especially his attack on Christianity and his concept of the "Overman," are highlighted as insightful, revolutionary, and compelling. His work is applauded for challenging conventional morality and sparking deep reflection. However, negative feedback centers on Nietzsche's perceived lack of logical coherence and repetitive arguments, which some find disorganized and even contradictory. Critics also note the difficulty of understanding his ideas due to his complex, rhetorical style. Overall, appreciation of Nietzsche's philosophical contributions is evident, though tempered by critiques of his method and style.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
182	Afternoons with Mr. Hogan	Ben Hogan's former ball shagger recounts firsthand stories of the golf legend—andreveals, for the first time, Hogan's Swing Secret, a source of mystery to golfers for more than fifty years. Ben Hogan's pro golf record is legendary. A four-time PGA Player of the Year, he celebrated sixty-three tournament wins and became known as a man of few words and fewer close friends. Most of what we know about Hogan has been based on myth and speculation. Until now. In the 1960s, though Hogan's competitive career was over, he kept the practice habits that made him famous and remade modern competitive golf. He hired seventeen-year-old Jody Vasquez to help. Each day, after driving to a remote part of the course at Shady Oaks Country Club, Hogan would spend hours hitting balls and Vasquez would retrieve them. There, and over the course of their twenty-year friendship, Hogan taught Jody the mechanics of his famous swing and shared his thoughts on playing, practicing, and course management—unknowingly revealing much about his character, values, and beliefs, and the events that shaped them. In Afternoons with Mr. Hogan, Jody Vasquez shares dozens of stories about Hogan, from the way he practiced, selected his clubs, and interacted with other star players to his little-known humor and generosity. Combining the gentle insight of Tom Kite's A Fairway to Heaven (which recalls Kite's golf education under Harvey Penick) with the sage perspective of Penick's own Little Red Book, Vasquez's tribute is funny, poignant, and full of advice for golfers of all levels.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=89y0kqRmqqgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=89y0kqRmqqgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Afternoons+with+Mr.+Hogan&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=89y0kqRmqqgC&source=gbs_api	Penguin	2005-03-24	{"Biography & Autobiography"}	1	"Afternoons with Mr. Hogan" by Jody Vasquez, a former ball shagger for the legendary golfer Ben Hogan, offers an intimate look at Hogan's personal life rather than groundbreaking golf techniques. Readers appreciate the nostalgic charm, highlighting Hogan's dedication and demystifying his famous "swing secret." It's a short, easy read providing insights into Hogan's humility and shy nature. While some find it enlightening and inspiring, especially those interested in golf's intricacies, others feel disappointed by the lack of new golfing tips and find it underwhelming. Overall, it's a delightful read for fans of golf and Ben Hogan.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Readers appreciate its accessible introduction to modern poetry and the way poems are curated to resonate with emotions and life experiences. Described as compelling and thought-provoking, the anthology is likened to "Chicken Soup for the Soul" for its impactful emotional reach. However, one review criticizes the book for aiming at the lowest common denominator and suggests it oversimplifies poetry. Overall, it’s highly recommended for poetry enthusiasts and newcomers alike.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

186	Marx's Concept Of Man	In publishing Marx's Concept of Man in 1961, Erich Fromm presented to the English-speaking world for the first time Karl Marx's then recently discovered Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Including the Manuscripts and many other philosophical writings by Marx as well as Fromm's own extended response, many of these writings have since become recognised as important works in their own right. Fromm stresses Marx's humanist philosophy and challenges both contemporary Western ignorance of Marx and Soviet corruptions of his work. Fromm's analysis of Marx's work and his dissemination of these neglected writings by Marx himself fundamentally altered the prevailing discourse about Marxism, revolutionising contemporary thought and providing a formative influence for the development of the New Left.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&dq=Marx%27s+Concept+Of+Man&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&dq=Marx%27s+Concept+Of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api	Bloomsbury Academic	2013-12-19	{Philosophy}	1	"Marx's Concept of Man" by Erich Fromm presents a humanist perspective on Karl Marx, contrasting with the traditional view of Marx focused on authoritarianism and economics. Using Marx's "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts" and "The German Ideology," Fromm highlights core humanist concepts like alienation, freedom, and creativity, emphasizing their significance in Marx's philosophy. The book includes an English translation of Marx's early manuscripts and personal memoirs that highlight his humanism, although Fromm occasionally overemphasizes Marx's spiritual nature. Positively noted for its accessible portrayal of Marxist humanism, it addresses misconceptions but sometimes overlooks weaknesses in Marx's ideology, offering a fresh lens on a misunderstood figure.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

188	The Canterbury Tales	In The Canterbury Tales Chaucer created one of the great touchstones of English literature, a masterly collection of chivalric romances, moral allegories and low farce. A story-telling competition between a group of pilgrims from all walks of life is the occasion for a series of tales that range from the Knight's account of courtly love and the ebullient Wife of Bath's Arthurian legend, to the ribald anecdotes of the Miller and the Cook.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eZGDIFy2pvkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=eZGDIFy2pvkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Canterbury+Tales&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eZGDIFy2pvkC&source=gbs_api	Penguin UK	2012-02-02	{Poetry}	3	The user reviews of "The Canterbury Tales" highlight a mix of positive and negative feedback.

Some reviewers find modern English translations, particularly by Nevill Coghill, helpful for accessibility, and enjoy the range of tales from serious to comedic. The book is noted for its insightful character portrayals and cultural commentary.\n\nNegatively, some readers find the Middle English challenging, even with translations. A few reviews express frustration with editions lacking content lists or containing poor formatting in digital versions.

Nearly a century has passed since George Herman Ruth made his major league debut, and in that time millions of words have been used to describe baseball’s greatest hero.

202	Torture And Modernity: Self, Society, And State In Modern Iran (Institutional Structures of Feeling)	What does the practice of torture presuppose about human beings and human society? How does one explain a society in which institutional torture persists despite massive changes in government and class structure? What, indeed, are the social foundations of modern torture? In Culture and Modernity, Darius M. Rejali investigates torture in Iran in order to understand and critically reconsider the politics and psychology of modern torture. In a world in which one out of every three governments uses torture, Rejali points to a common past, one shared by Iranians and non-Iranians alike, that supports this practice.“My aim,” Rejali writes, “is to use the study of torture, and of punishment more generally, to unearth deep and important assumptions about society, history, politics, and the ‘good life' that I believe underpin the life of a torturer.”Exploring the four principle explanations of modern torture—those offered by human rights activists, modernization theorists, state terrorist theorists such as Noam Chomsky, and post-structuralists, especially Michel Foucault—Rejali asks, “Do the accounts of political violence that we have developed over the past century have any real… explanatory or even moral significance… in today's world, or are they just consolations in the face of events we cannot fully understand?” His answers lead him to reconsider how Middle Eastern and European history are written and move him to question cherished assumptions about state formation, modernization, and postmodernism. Torture and Modernity is a deeply unsettling book—it contains not only graphic verbal passages, but an extensive photographic essay—yet it is intended to serve as a guide to rethinking current attitudes and reshaping political policies. How people are punished necessarily invokes conceptions of what human beings are and what they might become. A work such as this offers an understanding of what it means to “become modern,” and it is only when this notion of modernity is made manifest and analyzed that one can firmly grasp the prospects for a world without torture.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&q=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&dq=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=S5naAAAAMAAJ&dq=Torture+And+Modernity:+Self,+Society,+And+State+In+Modern+Iran+(Institutional+Structures+of+Feeling)&hl=&source=gbs_api	Westview Press	1994-01-01	{"Social Science"}	1	The book critically examines the history and role of torture in Iran's political system, highlighting its persistence across various regimes. Contrary to expectations, changes in punishment preceded state changes by decades, often occurring during political stability. The author, demonstrating deep knowledge of revolutionary theories, maintains academic neutrality and thoroughly analyzes different rationalities, such as disciplinary and capitalistic. Despite political upheavals, traditional state institutions persist, constraining revolutionaries. The book challenges the idea that modernization leads to less severe punishments, suggesting instead that modern torture rationalizes state power. The concluding chapter offers valuable insights, particularly from a Foucauldian perspective.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

213	Nietzsche's Corps/e: Aesthetics, Politics, Prophecy, or, the Spectacular Technoculture of Everyday Life (Post-Contemporary Interventions)	Appearing between two historical touchstones—the alleged end of communism and the 100th anniversary of Nietzsche’s death—this book offers a provocative hypothesis about the philosopher’s afterlife and the fate of leftist thought and culture. At issue is the relation of the dead Nietzsche (corpse) and his written work (corpus) to subsequent living Nietzscheanism across the political spectrum, but primarily among a leftist corps that has been programmed and manipulated by concealed dimensions of the philosopher’s thought. If anyone is responsible for what Geoff Waite maintains is the illusory death of communism, it is Nietzsche, the man and concept. Waite advances his argument by bringing Marxist—especially Gramscian and Althusserian—theories to bear on the concept of Nietzsche/anism. But he also goes beyond ideological convictions to explore the vast Nietzschean influence that proliferates throughout the marketplace of contemporary philosophy, political and literary theory, and cultural and technocultural criticism. In light of a philological reconstruction of Nietzsche’s published and unpublished texts, Nietzsche’s Corps/e shuttles between philosophy and everyday popular culture and shows them to be equally significant in their having been influenced by Nietzsche—in however distorted a form and in a way that compromises all of our best interests. Controversial in its “decelebration” of Nietzsche, this remarkable study asks whether the postcontemporary age already upon us will continue to be dominated and oriented by the haunting spectre of Nietzsche’s corps/e. Philosophers, intellectual historians, literary theorists, and those interested in western Marxism, popular culture, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the intersection of French and German thought will find this book both appealing and challenging.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=otlcb3jYifkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=otlcb3jYifkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nietzsche%27s+Corps/e:+Aesthetics,+Politics,+Prophecy,+or,+the+Spectacular+Technoculture+of+Everyday+Life+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=otlcb3jYifkC&dq=Nietzsche%27s+Corps/e:+Aesthetics,+Politics,+Prophecy,+or,+the+Spectacular+Technoculture+of+Everyday+Life+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&source=gbs_api	Duke University Press	1996-01-01	{Philosophy}	1	Geoffrey Waite's book, "Nietzsche's Corps/e," critiques the philosophical and political misappropriation of Nietzsche's works by poststructuralists and leftists, particularly at a 1972 symposium in France. Waite dissects themes such as Nietzsche's esoteric writing style and his notion of power, labeling Nietzsche's influence as pervasive and narcotic. Some reviewers appreciate the book's intelligence and bold interpretation of Nietzsche as undermining utopian ideals and contributing to a conservative agenda. However, others criticize Waite's scholarship as flawed, his arguments as convoluted, and the book's jargon-heavy style as inaccessible, perceiving it as more fantasy than a rigorous critique.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
214	Volcano in My Tummy: Helping Children to Handle Anger	A Volcano in My Tummy: Helping Children to Handle Anger presents a clear and effective approach to helping children and adults alike understand and deal constructively with children's anger. Using easy to understand yet rarely taught skills for anger management, including how to teach communication of emotions, A Volcano in My Tummy offers engaging, well-organized activities which help to overcome the fear of children's anger which many adult care-givers experience. By carefully distinguishing between anger the feeling, and violence the behavior, this accessible little book, primarily created for ages 6 to thirteen, helps to create an awareness of anger, enabling children to relate creatively and harmoniously at critical stages in their development. Through activities, stories, articles, and games designed to allow a multi-subject, developmental approach to the topic at home and in school, A Volcano in My Tummy gives us the tools we need to put aside our problems with this all-too-often destructive emotion, and to have fun while we're at it. Elaine Whitehouse is a teacher, family court and private psychotherapist, mother of two and leader of parenting skills workshops for eight years. Warwick Pudney is a teacher and counsellor with ten years experience facilitating anger management, abuser therapy and men's change groups, as well as being a father of three.

Therapists, counselors, and educators praise its simple imagery, engaging activities, and effective lessons, which guide children in expressing anger appropriately. It’s recommended for use in school or group settings, though some reviews note it's less suited for individual or real-life scenarios for very young children. While some find it slightly outdated, the book remains a valuable tool in educational environments but may not fulfill the needs of parents seeking direct support for their children's anger issues at home.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Positive feedback highlights the variety and deliciousness of the recipes, including juices and full meals, and appreciates its practicality for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Reviewers appreciate Null's longstanding expertise and creativity in health and juicing. However, criticisms focus on the book's lack of in-depth information on the health benefits of juicing, as it mainly offers recipes without detailed guidance on health improvements. Some expected more comprehensive advice on juicing for specific ailments, viewing it as a basic recipe book rather than a complete juicing guide. There are also concerns about Null's controversial health advice outside this book.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Readers praise the book's readability and value, making it a recommended choice for Tolkien fans. However, some critiques note a lack of deep insight and full accuracy in its references, and the choice of cover art is critiqued. For those seeking alternative readings, David Colbert's and Anne C.

This is the book that will enlighten the rest of us and delight us with the sheer beauty of his work. Divided into six sections, each beginning with an introductory conversation between Thompson and six well-known peers, including Bill Watterson, the book will present Thompson's illustration work, caricatures, and his creation, Richard's Poor Almanack.

However, it falls short in storytelling, with criticisms of repetitive writing, factual inaccuracies, and lack of engaging revelations about Thompson's personal life. Fans may appreciate the unique insights and pictures, but many reviews highlight Humphries' tendency to insert personal opinions and critiques, making the narrative less objective. While it fills a gap due to the lack of alternative biographies about Thompson, the book is criticized for being narrow in scope, focusing mainly on Thompson's recording career without broader life context.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
219	Polymath	Every human is born with multifarious potential. Why, then, do parents, schools and employers insist that we restrict our many talents and interests; that we 'specialise' in just one? We've been sold a myth, that to 'specialise' is the only way to pursue truth, identity, or even a livelihood. Yet specialisation is nothing but an outdated system that fosters ignorance, exploitation and disillusionment and thwarts creativity, opportunity and progress. Following a series of exchanges with the world’s greatest historians, futurists, philosophers and scientists, Waqas Ahmed has weaved together a narrative of history and a vision for the future that seeks to disrupt this prevailing system of unwarranted ‘hyper-specialisation.’ In The Polymath, Waqas shows us that there is another way of thinking and being. Through an approach that is both philosophical and practical, he sets out a cognitive journey towards reclaiming your innate polymathic state. Going further, he proposes nothing less than a cultural revolution in our education and professional structures, whereby everyone is encouraged to express themselves in multiple ways and fulfil their many-sided potential. Not only does this enhance individual fulfilment, but in doing so, facilitates a conscious and creative society that is both highly motivated and well equipped to address the complexity of 21st century challenges.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Polymath&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=N5RxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Polymath&hl=&source=gbs_api	Wiley	2018-11-19	{"Business & Economics"}	3	John Brunner's "Polymath" is a compelling science fiction novel about survival on an alien planet by refugees escaping a nova-destroyed home world. Though criticized for its lack of originality and weak female character development, it is praised for its engaging survival plot and diverse character interactions. It features the intelligent character Lex, a polymath and planetary engineer, whose leadership contrasts sharply with a rival group embodying chaos. While some reviewers found the plot rigid and predictable, others appreciated Brunner's storytelling and the book's reflective themes. Despite mixed reviews on character depth and originality, "Polymath" is considered a worthwhile read for showcasing human resilience in extreme conditions.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
220	Portraits from Memory and Other Essays	‘I have come to think that one of the main causes of trouble in the world is dogmatic and fanatical belief in some doctrine for which there is no adequate evidence.’ – Bertrand Russell, Portraits from Memory Portraits from Memory is one of Bertrand Russell’s most self-reflective and engaging books. Whilst not intended as an autobiography, it is a vivid recollection of some of his celebrated contemporaries, such as George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb and D. H. Lawrence. Russell provides some arresting and sometimes amusing insights into writers with whom he corresponded. He was fascinated by Joseph Conrad, with whom he formed a strong emotional bond, writing that his Heart of Darkness was not just a story but an expression of Conrad’s ‘philosophy of life’. There are also some typically pithy Russellian observations; H. G. Wells ‘derived his importance from quantity rather than quality’, whilst after a brief and fraught friendship Russell thought D. H. Lawrence ‘had no real wish to make the world better, but only to indulge in eloquent soliloquy about how bad it was’. This engaging book also includes some of Russell’s customary razor-sharp essays on a rich array of subjects, from his ardent pacifism, liberal politics and morality to the ethics of education, the skills of good writing and how he came to philosophy as a young man. These include ‘A Plea for Clear Thinking’, ‘A Philosophy for Our Time’ and ‘How I Write’. Portraits from Memory is Russell at his best and will enthrall those new to Russell as well as those already well-acquainted with his work. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new foreword by the Russell scholar Nicholas Griffin, editor of The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portraits+from+Memory+and+Other+Essays&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Routledge	2020-11-29	{Philosophy}	1	The book provides an autobiographical account of Bertrand Russell's life and perspectives, alongside detailed portraits of influential figures. Russell reflects on witnessing the fall of empires post-WWI and his disillusionment with Russia's authoritarianism. Despite global crises, he remains optimistic about humanity's potential, emphasizing the need for security, poverty abolition, and tolerance. He critiques figures like G.B. Shaw for chaotic opinions and applauds others like A.N. Whitehead as perfect teachers. Russell also questions Descartes' philosophies and criticizes the trivialization of philosophy by linguists. Ultimately, the book remains a significant read for those passionate about Russell's vision and humanity's future challenges.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

222	Contra Keynes and Cambridge: Essays, Correspondence (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Vol 9)	Friedrich A. Hayek is regarded as one of the preeminent economic theorists of the twentieth century, as much for his work outside of economics as for his work within it. During a career spanning several decades, he made contributions in fields as diverse as psychology, political philosophy, the history of ideas, and the methodology of the social sciences. Bruce Caldwell—editor of The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek—understands Hayek's thought like few others, and with this book he offers us the first full intellectual biography of this pivotal social theorist. Caldwell begins by providing the necessary background for understanding Hayek's thought, tracing the emergence, in fin-de-siècle Vienna, of the Austrian school of economics—a distinctive analysis forged in the midst of contending schools of thought. In the second part of the book, Caldwell follows the path by which Hayek, beginning from the standard Austrian assumptions, gradually developed his unique perspective on not only economics but a broad range of social phenomena. In the third part, Caldwell offers both an assessment of Hayek's arguments and, in an epilogue, an insightful estimation of how Hayek's insights can help us to clarify and reexamine changes in the field of economics during the twentieth century. As Hayek's ideas matured, he became increasingly critical of developments within mainstream economics: his works grew increasingly contrarian and evolved in striking—and sometimes seemingly contradictory—ways. Caldwell is ideally suited to explain the complex evolution of Hayek's thought, and his analysis here is nothing short of brilliant, impressively situating Hayek in a broader intellectual context, unpacking the often difficult turns in his thinking, and showing how his economic ideas came to inform his ideas on the other social sciences. Hayek's Challenge will be received as one of the most important works published on this thinker in recent decades.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&pg=PA452&dq=Contra+Keynes+and+Cambridge:+Essays,+Correspondence+(The+Collected+Works+of+F.+A.+Hayek,+Vol+9)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC&source=gbs_api	University of Chicago Press	2008-12-05	{"Business & Economics"}	1	This collection of writings from the early 1930s captures the critical intellectual exchange between economists Hayek, Keynes, and Sraffa, focusing on theories of capital, uncertainty, and economic downturns during The Great Depression. Reviews highlight Bruce Caldwell's introduction as particularly valuable. Critics note Hayek's early dismissal of uncertainty in capital theory, contrasting it with Keynes's emphasis on uncertainty's role in economic decision-making. While Keynes's theories advocated government intervention, Hayek favored market solutions, sparking debates still relevant today. The book is praised for its historical insights but criticized for not thoroughly representing Keynes's evolved theories, often misunderstood by later economists.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Positively, it is praised as an enjoyable and lucid introduction to Western philosophy, suitable for newcomers, and valuable as a teaching tool in philosophy classes. However, it faced criticism for its perceived bias and misrepresentation, particularly in its treatment of Christian fundamentalism. One reviewer finds the authors' attacks on fundamentalism inaccurate and misleading, suggesting the title should reflect its liberal Christian perspective. While the book is appreciated for its historical coverage and readability, its depth might not satisfy readers already familiar with key philosophical figures.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

224	Courage	"Extraordinary, wise, and hopeful…nearly poetic meditations." —Boston Globe What if imagination and art are not, as many of us might think, the frosting on life but the fountainhead of human experience? What if our logic and science derive from art forms, rather than the other way around? In this trenchant volume, Rollo May helps all of us find those creative impulses that, once liberated, offer new possibilities for achievement. A renowned therapist and inspiring guide, Dr. May draws on his experience to show how we can break out of old patterns in our lives. His insightful book offers us a way through our fears into a fully realized self.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q1UsFy7cNKkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q1UsFy7cNKkC&dq=Courage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q1UsFy7cNKkC&dq=Courage&hl=&source=gbs_api	W. W. Norton & Company	1994-03-17	{Psychology}	4	J.M. Barrie's address, "Courage," delivered to St. Andrews' graduates in 1922, remains relevant today, emphasizing bravery in life's journey. While it touches on war due to WWI, Barrie also movingly references Admiral Byrd's letter from an Antarctic expedition facing death. His speech encourages growth and resilience, likened to remembering "roses in December." However, it doesn't reference Barrie's famous Peter Pan characters, except for a nod to youthful spirit with "the lad what will never be old." Barrie's humor shines through as he remarks on being less dull than intended, uplifted by the students' hopeful faces.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

230	Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University: A University President's Perspective	After decades of domination on campus, college sports' supremacy has begun to weaken. "Enough, already!" detractors cry. College is about learning, not chasing a ball around to the whir of TV cameras. In Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University James Duderstadt agrees, taking the view that the increased commercialization of intercollegiate athletics endangers our universities and their primary goal, academics. Calling it a "corrosive example of entertainment culture" during an interview with ESPN's Bob Ley, Duderstadt suggested that college basketball, for example, "imposes on the university an alien set of values, a culture that really is not conducive to the educational mission of university." Duderstadt is part of a growing controversy. Recently, as reported in The New York Times, an alliance between university professors and college boards of trustees formed in reaction to the growth of college sports; it's the first organization with enough clout to challenge the culture of big-time university athletics. This book is certainly part of that challenge, and is sure to influence this debate today and in the years to come. James J. Duderstadt is President Emeritus and University Professor of Science and Engineering, University of Michigan.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RG0FsdsXnQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=RG0FsdsXnQkC&pg=PA271&dq=Intercollegiate+Athletics+and+the+American+University:+A+University+President%27s+Perspective&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=RG0FsdsXnQkC&dq=Intercollegiate+Athletics+and+the+American+University:+A+University+President%27s+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api	University of Michigan Press	2009-04-21	{Education}	2	Jim Duderstadt's book critiques the excesses of Division I athletic programs, especially in basketball and football, highlighting the need for reform due to the financial and ethical challenges they pose to universities. While he praises the value of other sports, he criticizes university leaders for shifting accountability for the professionalization of college sports. Although respected for his insights as a former university president and athlete, some criticize him for previously enabling problematic programs. His book is appreciated for its different perspective on the issue but seen as offering limited solutions. Reviews suggest it’s insightful for understanding college athletics' financial impact.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

232	Field Quantization	Theoretical physics has become a many-faceted science. For the young stu dent it is difficult enough to cope with the overwhelming amount of new scientific material that has to be learned, let alone obtain an overview of the entire field, which ranges from mechanics through electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, field theory, nuclear and heavy-ion science, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and solid-state theory to elementary-particle physics. And this knowledge should be acquired in just 8-10 semesters, during which, in addition, a Diploma or Master's thesis has to be worked on or examinations prepared for. All this can be achieved only if the university teachers help to introduce the student to the new disciplines as early on as possible, in order to create interest and excitement that in turn set free essential new energy. At the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt we therefore con front the student with theoretical physics immediately, in the first semester. Theoretical Mechanics I and II, Electrodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics I - An Introduction are the basic courses during the first two years. These lectures are supplemented with many mathematical explanations and much support material. After the fourth semester of studies, graduate work begins, and Quantum Mechanics II - Symmetries, Statistical Mechanics and Ther modynamics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Electrodynamics, the Gauge Theory of Weak Interactions, and Quantum Chromo dynamics are obligatory.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C-DVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=C-DVBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Field+Quantization&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C-DVBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Springer Science & Business Media	2013-06-29	{Science}	1	The book on quantum field theory by Greiner is generally well-received for its thorough explanations and systematic progression from classical to quantum field theories, including detailed coverage of topics like path integrals and Feynman rules. Positive feedback highlights the book’s instructional examples and clear organization, making it a solid introductory text for graduate students, providing meaningful context for complex subjects. However, some critique focuses on the "sloppy" mathematical exposition, which lacks rigor and intuition, potentially obscuring physical concepts.

241	The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco	A journey back through the music, madness, and unparalleled freedom of an era of change-the '70s-as told through the life of ultra-fabulous superstar Sylvester Imagine a pied piper singing in a dazzling falsetto, wearing glittering sequins, and leading the young people of the nation to San Francisco and on to liberation where nothing was straight-laced or old-fashioned. And everyone, finally, was welcome-to come as themselves. This is not a fairy tale. This was real, mighty real, and disco sensation Sylvester was the piper. Joshua Gamson-a Yale-trained pop culture expert-uses him, a boy who would be fabulous, to lead us through the story of the '70s when a new era of change liberated us from conformity and boredom. Gamson captures the exuberant life, feeling, energy, and fun of a generation's wonderful, magical waking up-from the parties to the dancing and music. The story begins with a little black boy who started with nothing but a really big voice. We follow him from the Gospel chorus to the glory days in the Castro where a generation shook off its shame as Sylvester sang and began his rise as part of a now-notorious theatrical troup called the Cockettes. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle and merge around this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Fabulous+Sylvester:+The+Legend,+the+Music,+the+Seventies+in+San+Francisco&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Y0TAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Henry Holt and Company	2013-07-30	{Music}	3	The reviews for "The Fabulous Sylvester" by Joshua Gamson highlight the thorough and entertaining depiction of Sylvester, an iconic figure in the disco scene and a pioneering force in the San Francisco gay community.

Drawing on a wide variety of materials, Smutty Little Movies de-centers the film text in favor of industrial histories and contexts.

248	Eyeshot (Wesleyan Poetry Series)	Scintillating new work from a celebrated contemporary poet. Runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (2004) Runner-up for the ForeWord magazine's Book of the Year Award (2003) Heather McHugh's new book, Eyeshot, is a brooding, visionary work that takes aim at the big questions—those of love and death. The poems suggest that such immensities balance on the smallest details, and that a range of human blindness is inescapable. The power of this new work comes from its delicate yet tenacious fidelity to the ever-unfolding senses of sense. The poems invite the reader to follow careening words and insights through passages both playful and profound. Her "Fido, Jolted by Jove" reveals the tension endemic to both language and living: "the world itself is worried." Yet the same poem remarks the high price of any reductive fix: "a brain this insecure may need another bolt be driven in it." This movement between anxiety and the human compulsion for order informs Eyeshot's darkly comic, 20/20 acuity.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v3D2F6eAV-4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=v3D2F6eAV-4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eyeshot+(Wesleyan+Poetry+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=v3D2F6eAV-4C&dq=Eyeshot+(Wesleyan+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api	Wesleyan University Press	2004-12-29	{Poetry}	1	Heather McHugh's "Eyeshot" is a highly praised collection that explores language with complexity and playfulness. Critics commend McHugh's mastery of linguistic experimentation, using techniques such as puns, anagrams, and homonyms to create rich wordplay. The poetry intertwines sound, sight, and meaning through humor and irony, tackling serious themes like love, displacement, and death. While McHugh's work can initially be challenging due to its layered language and innovative structure, readers find the experience rewarding after multiple readings. Some reviewers note the collection's mix of free-verse and formal poetry as a highlight, demonstrating McHugh's rhythmic and narrative prowess. The book is regarded as both entertaining and profound, appealing to those intrigued by linguistic exploration.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

261	Better Together : Restoring the American Community	In his acclaimed bestselling book, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, Robert Putnam described a thirty-year decline in America's social institutions. The book ended with the hope that new forms of social connection might be invented in order to revive our communities. In Better Together, Putnam and longtime civic activist Lewis Feldstein describe some of the diverse locations and most compelling ways in which civic renewal is taking place today. In response to civic crises and local problems, they say, hardworking, committed people are reweaving the social fabric all across America, often in innovative ways that may turn out to be appropriate for the twenty-first century. Better Together is a book of stories about people who are building communities to solve specific problems. The examples Putnam and Feldstein describe span the country from big cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago to the Los Angeles suburbs, small Mississippi and Wisconsin towns, and quiet rural areas. The projects range from the strictly local to that of the men and women of UPS, who cover the nation. Bowling Alone looked at America from a broad and general perspective. Better Together takes us into Catherine Flannery's Roxbury, Massachusetts, living room, a UPS loading dock in Greensboro, North Carolina, a Philadelphia classroom, the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, naval shipyard, and a Bay Area Web site. We meet activists driven by their visions, each of whom has chosen to succeed by building community: Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley who want paved roads, running water, and decent schools; Harvard University clerical workers searching for respect and improved working conditions; Waupun, Wisconsin, schoolchildren organizing to improve safety at a local railroad crossing; and merchants in Tupelo, Mississippi, joining with farmers to improve their economic status. As the stories in Better Together demonstrate, bringing people together by building on personal relationships remains one of the most effective strategies to enhance America's social health.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qledfXzFImcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=qledfXzFImcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Better+Together+:+Restoring+the+American+Community&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qledfXzFImcC&source=gbs_api	Simon and Schuster	2009-12-01	{"Social Science"}	1	"Better Together: Restoring the American Community" by Robert Putnam, Lewis M. Feldstein, and Don Cohen explores twelve diverse groups that have successfully built social capital and strengthened community ties. Some reviewers praise the book's inspirational real-life examples and its positive depiction of community-building efforts, from a dance project in New Hampshire to Chicago's branch libraries. However, others criticize it for lacking depth and practical guidelines, claiming it presents overly optimistic stories without addressing complex societal issues or providing actionable solutions. While some find the book insightful for understanding social isolation, others feel it falls short as a comprehensive companion to Putnam's "Bowling Alone."	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

266	Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us	2014 Reprint of 1958 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Caroline Spurgeon is known as the first female university professor in London, the second in England. In 1935, Spurgeon wrote this pioneer study on the use of images in William Shakespeare's opus. In it she analyses the different types of images and motifs that he uses in his plays. She also shows that there is a "cluster," or there are several "clusters," of images in each of the major plays, for instance, illness and injury images in "Hamlet," and light and darkness images in "Romeo and Juliet."

The resistance is against the inhumanity of the new world economic order. The people coming together are the reader, me and those the essays are about - Rembrandt, Palaeolithic cave painters, a Romanian peasant, ancient Egyptians, an expert in the loneliness of certain hotel bedrooms, dogs at dusk, a man in a radio station. And unexpectedly, our exchanges strengthen each of us in our conviction that what is happening to the world today is wrong, and that what is often said about it is a lie.

273	D.V.	Written by Stu Maschwitz, co-founder of the Orphanage (the legendary guerrilla visual effects studio responsible for amazing and award-winning effects in such movies as Sin City, The Day After Tomorrow, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), this book is a must-have for all those budding filmmakers and students who want to produce action movies with visual effects but don't have Hollywood budgets. The Orphanage was created by three twenty-something visual effects veterans who wanted to make their own feature films and discovered they could do this by utilizing home computers, off the shelf software, and approaching things artistically. This guide details exactly how to do this: from planning and selecting the necessary cameras, software, and equipment, to creating specific special effects (including gunfire, Kung Fu fighting, car chases, dismemberment, and more) to editing and mixing sound and music. Its mantra is that the best, low-budget action moviemakers must visualize the end product first in order to reverse-engineer the least expensive way to get there. Readers will learn how to integrate visual effects into every aspect of filmmaking--before filming, during filming and with "in camera" shots, and with computers in postproduction. Throughout the book, the author makes specific references to and uses popular action movies (both low and big-budget) as detailed examples--including El Mariachi, La Femme Nikita, Die Hard, and Terminator 2.

281	Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black	Tiger Woods has called the U.S. Open "the most difficult national championship." With Open, John Feinstein goes behind the scenes to tell for the first time the full story of how the 2002 U.S. Open Championship came into being-how a public course was transformed into one of the most difficult and surprising in the tournament's history, and how the greatest golfers in the world rose to its almost insurmountable challenges. The Black course at the public golf club in Bethpage, New York, has long had a mythic status among golfers. Designed by legendary course architect A. W. Tillinghast in 1936, it is known as a work of genius-with long fairways, gorgeous vistas, and roughs and bunkers that stymie all but the very best golfers. It is a course where any player can compete, but its cult reputation means that golfers often have to camp overnight in the parking lot to get a tee time the next day. The 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black was the first time in history that golf's greatest championship had been held at a true public course. Open is the full drama of that championship, from the moment that officials first considered holding it there until the last putt rolled in at dusk on Sunday. Along the way, John Feinstein reveals the full glory of golf as it's never been explored before. He digs deep to find out what it really takes to make golf's most famous event worthy of the champions who compete in it. He tells the remarkable story of the artisans who transformed the Black from a downtrodden and rough-around-the-edges public course to one that top pros hailed as "unbelievable" and "the toughest par-70 I've ever played in my life." He also tracks the drama of the masters who battled for supremacy at the Black-Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia, Nick Faldo, Phil Mickelson, Jeff Maggert-to show how true champions respond to the toughest conditions. Open is the story of people who devote their entire lives to golf, both behind the scenes and inside the ropes. Their struggles and exhilarations as they master the monster known as Bethpage Black make for a story every golf lover will want to read again and again.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ffM5AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=ffM5AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Open:+Inside+the+Ropes+at+Bethpage+Black&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ffM5AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Hachette UK	2003-05-01	{"Sports & Recreation"}	2	"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black" by John Feinstein receives mixed reviews.

Positive feedback highlights Feinstein's in-depth storytelling, acknowledging his skill in providing a unique look at event management and celebrating the hard work of the event organizers. However, many critics argue the book overemphasizes minutiae, biographies of unknown figures, and logistical details at the expense of covering the actual golf tournament, leaving avid sports fans disappointed.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

291	American Apartheid	This powerful and disturbing book clearly links persistent poverty among blacks in the United States to the unparalleled degree of deliberate segregation they experience in American cities. American Apartheid shows how the black ghetto was created by whites during the first half of the twentieth century in order to isolate growing urban black populations. It goes on to show that, despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, segregation is perpetuated today through an interlocking set of individual actions, institutional practices, and governmental policies. In some urban areas the degree of black segregation is so intense and occurs in so many dimensions simultaneously that it amounts to “hypersegregation.” Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton demonstrate that this systematic segregation of African Americans leads inexorably to the creation of underclass communities during periods of economic downturn. Under conditions of extreme segregation, any increase in the overall rate of black poverty yields a marked increase in the geographic concentration of indigence and the deterioration of social and economic conditions in black communities. As ghetto residents adapt to this increasingly harsh environment under a climate of racial isolation, they evolve attitudes, behaviors, and practices that further marginalize their neighborhoods and undermine their chances of success in mainstream American society. This book is a sober challenge to those who argue that race is of declining significance in the United States today.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S2zsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=S2zsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=American+Apartheid&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S2zsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Harvard University Press	1998-07-15	{"Social Science"}	2	The book provides an informative, eye-opening, and thought-provoking experience, as the author delivers candid insights without hesitation.

288	The Devil's Picnic: Around the World in Pursuit of Forbidden Fruit	A journey into illicit pleasure the world over. From Norwegian moonshine to the pentobarbital sodium sipped by suicide tourists in Switzerland—and,, in between, baby eels killed by an infusion of tobacco, a garlicky Spanish stew of bull’s testicles, tea laced with cocaine, and malodorous French cheese—Taras Grescoe has written a travelogue of forbidden indulgences. As Grescoe crisscrosses the globe in pursuit of his quarry, he delves into questions of regional culture and repressive legislation—from the clandestine absinthe distillation in an obscure Swiss valley to the banning of poppy seed biscuits in Singapore—and launches into a philosophical investigation of what’s truly bizarre: how something as fundamental as the plants and foods we consume could be so vilified and demonized. An investigation into what thrills us, what terrifies us, and what would make us travel ten thousand miles and evade the local authorities, The Devil’s Picnic is a delicious and compelling expedition into the heart of vice and desire.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JLx8QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=JLx8QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Devil%27s+Picnic:+Around+the+World+in+Pursuit+of+Forbidden+Fruit&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=JLx8QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Devil%27s+Picnic:+Around+the+World+in+Pursuit+of+Forbidden+Fruit&hl=&source=gbs_api	Bloomsbury USA	2005-09-01	{Travel}	7	"The Devil's Picnic" by Taras Grescoe is a travelogue exploring global prohibitions on consumable items, advocating a libertarian view against such bans. Grescoe journeys to various countries, sampling forbidden items—from Norwegian moonshine to Bolivian coca tea—while examining these restrictions' historical and societal contexts. The writing is praised for being engaging, blending personal anecdotes with thorough research and interviews. However, the Singapore chapter feels misplaced, showcasing Grescoe flouting laws needlessly. Compared to Anthony Bourdain and Michael Pollan, Grescoe delivers a vivid but serious exploration of prohibitions, with the book being both informative and entertaining for readers interested in food and libertarian themes.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Positively, users appreciate its binder style with removable sections and the accompanying CD-ROM for guest list management. However, they criticize the lack of tabs on dividers and folders for loose papers, suggesting adding separate tabs and plastic page holders. While one reviewer finds it comprehensive, another deems it unnecessary and bulky, stating most advice is basic knowledge or excessive. Though one user recommends online resources as alternatives, they still recommend the planner for brides seeking organization, despite the need for improvements in guest list management and storage solutions.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

292	Caravaggio (Rizzoli Quadrifolio)	Mobile homes--or manufactured housing, as they are called today--provide shelter for more than twelve and a half million Americans, and in the last two decades have accounted for one quarter of all new single family housing produced annually. Yet they have been attacked as unsafe and unsatisfactory, and critics have argued that they should be banned or restricted. But to Allan Wallis, the mobile home embodies many of the most fundamental American ideals of home and community. In Wheel Estate, Allan Wallis offers a lively and informative history of this much-maligned form of housing over six decades. He begins with the travel trailers of the late 1920s and 1930s, describing models that were built like yachts or unfolded like Polaroid cameras. With the Second World War, Wallis writes, the industry mushroomed as trailers became homes for thousands of defense workers; he vividly portrays the communities they lived in and the trailer houses that were turned out under government contract. After the war, severe housing shortages sustained demand for trailers as year-round housing. The industry responded with new models--now called mobile homes--that tried to strike a balance between house and vehicle, even as owners built their own often fanciful additions (including one mobile home complete with Egyptian pylons). The results, illustrated in Wheel Estate, were sometimes comic, but they revealed what Americans thought their housing ought to look like. The need for mobile homes today has only grown as the housing crisis continues to deepen. Wallis reviews recent efforts to remove barriers against the use of manufactured housing and to assure construction quality, and he discusses how some of these efforts have backfired, making mobile homes less affordable. Wallis argues that, despite moves to restrict mobile homes, they remain a useful and distinctively American form of housing. This colorful account, extensively illustrated with period photographs and vivid portraits of the people who live in mobile homes and the industry pioneers who designed and built them, will inform and amuse anyone curious about this American phenomenon.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tEbrAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=tEbrAAAAMAAJ&q=Caravaggio+(Rizzoli+Quadrifolio)&dq=Caravaggio+(Rizzoli+Quadrifolio)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=tEbrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Caravaggio+(Rizzoli+Quadrifolio)&hl=&source=gbs_api	Rizzoli International Publications	2001-01-01	{Art}	1	The user reviews for this art book are mixed, highlighting both positive and negative aspects.

On the positive side, others appreciate the innovative quadrifolio design, which reveals large images and is ideal for students and art lovers. Negative feedback also includes customer service issues, with one user receiving a damaged book and facing difficulties in returning it for a refund, expressing dissatisfaction with both the condition and the dealer's response.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

294	The Art of Loving	The landmark bestseller that changed the way we think about love: “Every line is packed with common sense, compassion, and realism” (Fortune). The Art of Loving is a rich and detailed guide to love—an achievement reached through maturity, practice, concentration, and courage. In the decades since the book’s release, its words and lessons continue to resonate. Erich Fromm, a celebrated psychoanalyst and social psychologist, clearly and sincerely encourages the development of our capacity for and understanding of love in all of its facets. He discusses the familiar yet misunderstood romantic love, the all-encompassing brotherly love, spiritual love, and many more. A challenge to traditional Western notions of love, The Art of Loving is a modern classic about taking care of ourselves through relationships with others by the New York Times–bestselling author of To Have or To Be? and Escape from Freedom. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Erich Fromm including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author’s estate.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pM8MzzntBRcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=pM8MzzntBRcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Art+of+Loving&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pM8MzzntBRcC&source=gbs_api	Open Road Media	2013-02-26	{Psychology}	3	Erich Fromm's "The Art of Loving" is lauded for its profound exploration of love as a deliberate art that requires practice and commitment, rather than a mere passive feeling. Reviewers find it thought-provoking and life-changing, appreciating its analysis of various forms of love, including parental, romantic, brotherly, self-love, and love of God. The book distinguishes between genuine love, which involves care, respect, responsibility, and knowledge, and infatuation or dependency-driven relationships. While praised for its insights into human nature and societal impact on love, some criticize its outdated views on gender roles and homosexuality, and its sometimes dense, theoretical style. Despite mixed opinions on its practical application, the book remains influential for understanding love's complexity and necessity for personal and societal well-being.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
295	Isaiah Effect	Seventeen hundred years ago, key elements of our ancient heritage were lost, relegated to the esoteric traditions of mystery schools and sacred orders. Among the most empowering of the forgotten elements are references to a science with the power to bring everlasting healing to our bodies and initiate an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between governments and nations. In his groundbreaking new book, The Isaiah Effect, Gregg Braden turns to the Isaiah Scroll, perhaps the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1946, to offer insight into a powerful form of ancient prayer. In The Isaiah Effect, Braden, author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, combines research in quantum physics with the works of the prophet Isaiah and the ancient Essenes. He demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom, and that we have the power to influence those possibilities. In addition to describing multiple futures, the Isaiah texts take us one step further, clearly describing the science of how we choose our futures. Tracing key words of Isaiah's text back to their original language, we discover how he taught a mode of prayer that was lost to the West during Biblical editing in the fourth century. Braden offers detailed accounts of how elements of this mode of prayer have been applied in a variety of situations, ranging from healing life-threatening conditions to entire villages using collective prayer to prevail during the 1998 fires in southern Peru. In each instance, the correlation between the offering of the prayer and a shift of the events in question was beyond coincidence--the prayers had measurable effects! As modern science continues to validate a relationship between our outer and inner worlds, it becomes more likely that a forgotten bridge links the world of our prayers with that of our experience. Each time we engage ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities with Isaiah's life-affirming message of hope, we secure nothing less than our future and the future of the only home we know.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=858MnPizsnkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=858MnPizsnkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Isaiah+Effect&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=858MnPizsnkC&source=gbs_api	Harmony	2009-02-04	{"Body, Mind & Spirit"}	3	Gregg Braden's "The Isaiah Effect" is praised for its exploration of ancient prayer techniques and the merging of spiritual insights with modern science, particularly quantum physics. Readers appreciate Braden's ability to synthesize various religious and cultural teachings, including those of the Essenes and Tibetan monks, and find his theories empowering, offering hope for personal and global transformation. Many reviews highlight the book's unique perspective on choosing one's reality through mindful prayer, aligning thoughts, emotions, and beliefs. However, some criticize Braden's scholarship, noting repetitive content, reliance on controversial sources, and a lack of substantial evidence for his claims, while others find the title misleading. Overall, the book is seen as inspiring and thought-provoking, particularly for those interested in metaphysics and spiritual growth.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Some users found it informative, noting its progression from relational to object-oriented databases and its suitability for those with some prior knowledge of database concepts. A few appreciated its practicality in educational settings. However, criticisms include its lack of depth, unclear target audience, and mediocre quality compared to existing literature. Several reviewers felt the book was basic, with redundant examples and typographical errors. It is seen as a useful introduction but insufficient on its own, with suggested alternatives such as works by Won Kim, Stonebraker, and the UML Distilled for deeper learning.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Several runners noted significant improvements in their running experience and efficiency, leading to injury-free running and even personal records in races. The book is praised for being well-written, easy to follow, with valuable advice on technique and body awareness.\n\nHowever, some criticisms are noted. A few reviewers found the inclusion of Eastern philosophy unnecessary or found the concepts common knowledge rather than revelations. Others mentioned issues with repetitive content and perceived self-promotion through constant mentions of associated DVDs and workshops. Some found the scientific explanations lacking or disagreed with the advice, such as the midfoot landing technique not suiting everyone. Despite these critiques, many found the book worthwhile and beneficial overall, particularly for those dealing with running injuries or looking to improve their running efficiency.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
298	On the aesthetic education of man,	A classic of 18th-century thought, Schiller’s treatise on the role of art in society ranks among German philosophy’s most profound works. An important contribution to the history of ideas, it employs a political analysis of contemporary society—and of the French Revolution, in particular—to define the relationship between beauty and art. Schiller’s proposal of art as fundamental to the development of society and the individual remains an influential concept, and this volume offers his philosophy’s clearest, most relevant expression. Translated and with an introduction by Reginald Snell.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GJb0T939CHEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=GJb0T939CHEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=On+the+aesthetic+education+of+man,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=GJb0T939CHEC&dq=On+the+aesthetic+education+of+man,&hl=&source=gbs_api	Courier Corporation	2004-01-01	{Philosophy}	1	Schiller's "Letters on Aesthetic Education" blends Kantian and Platonic philosophy to explore the development of individuals and Western civilization, emphasizing artistic experience's role in healthy growth. The work is praised for its beautiful prose, insightful reflections into its era's societal challenges, and accessibility compared to Kant’s more dense writings. It's seen as a bridge to understanding 19th-century German philosophers and Romanticism's ongoing influence, linking historical and modern artistic expressions. Positive feedback highlights the effective translation and engaging format, while criticism is minimal, mainly noting the complexity some might find challenging. Schiller's work is highly recommended for its intellectual depth and cultural relevance.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
299	The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade	If you care about the education of a child, you need this book. Comprehensive and easy to use, it will inform, empower, and encourage you. Just as William J. Bennett's The Book of Virtues has helped millions of Americans teach young people about character, The Educated Child delivers what you need to take control. With coauthors Chester E. Finn, Jr., and John T. E. Cribb, Jr., former Secretary of Education Bennett provides the indispensable guide. Championing a clear "back-to-basics" curriculum that will resonate with parents and teachers tired of fads and jargon, The Educated Child supplies an educational road map from earliest childhood to the threshold of high school. It gives parents hundreds of practical suggestions for helping each child succeed while showing what to look for in a good school and what to watch out for in a weak one. The Educated Child places you squarely at the center of your young one's academic career and takes a no-nonsense view of your responsibilities. It empowers you as mothers and fathers, enabling you to reclaim what has been appropriated by "experts" and the education establishment. It out-lines questions you will want to ask, then explains the answers -- or non-answers -- you will be given. No longer will you feel powerless before the education "system." The tools and advice in this guide put the power where it belongs -- in the hands of those who know and love their children best. Using excerpts from E. D. Hirsch's Core Knowledge Sequence, The Educated Child sets forth a state-of-the art curriculum from kindergarten through eighth grade that you can use to monitor what is and isn't being taught in your school. It outlines how you can help teachers ensure that your child masters the most important skills and knowledge. It takes on today's education controversies from phonics to school choice, from outcomes-based education to teaching values, from the education of gifted children to the needs of the disabled. Because much of a youngster's education takes place outside the school, The Educated Child also distills the essential information you need to prepare children for kindergarten and explains to the parents of older students how to deal with such challenges as television, drugs, and sex. If you seek high standards and solid, time-tested content for the child you care so much about, if you want the unvarnished truth about what parents and schools must do, The Educated Child is the one book you need on your shelf.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HJVAcIjPDjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=HJVAcIjPDjUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Educated+Child+:+A+Parents+Guide+From+Preschool+Through+Eighth+Grade&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HJVAcIjPDjUC&source=gbs_api	Simon and Schuster	1999-12-24	{Education}	6	"The Educated Child: A Parent's Guide from Preschool Through Eighth Grade" by William J. Bennett et al. receives mixed reviews. Critics argue the book is overly preachy, repetitive, and lacks practical advice, focusing too much on criticizing the public education system. Some found it conservative, pushing rote learning over critical thinking, while others felt it blamed schools without acknowledging systemic issues like varied teaching methods and disparities in schools. On the positive side, many reviewers appreciate the structured core curriculum guidance, grade-specific learning objectives, and extensive reading lists, highlighting its usefulness for parents aiming to supplement their children's education. It's praised for encouraging parental involvement and offering practical advice. However, the book's tone and approach might not resonate with those seeking flexibility in educational philosophy or wary of its conservative angles.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

It is praised for enabling an affordable retreat-like experience but is criticized for its impracticality, with readers finding it challenging to devote an entire week to such activities. Additionally, the book is seen as largely a rehash of the author's previous work, "Witch: A Magickal Journey," leading some to view it as an attempt to profit from recycled content. While it features ideas like daily affirmations and rituals, it's considered self-centered and not appealing to serious practitioners.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
301	The Starter Marriage: A Novel	The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony is a pioneering study of first marriages lasting five years or less and ending without children, and of the changing face of matrimony in America. According to the brilliant trend analyst and journalist Pamela Paul, “It’s easy to conclude that the starter marriage trend bodes ill for the state of marriage. After all, we’re getting married, screwing it up, and divorcing—a practice that certainly isn’t strengthening our sense of trust, family, or commitment. But though starter marriages seem like a grim prospect, there is also an upside. For one thing, if people are going to divorce, better to do so after a brief marriage in which no children suffer the consequences.” But are there other consequences of starter marriages? And what causes these marriages to fail in the first place? In today’s matrimania culture, weddings, marriage, and family are clearly goals to which most young Americans aspire. Why are today’s twenty- and thirtysomethings—the first children-of-divorce generation—so eager to get married, and so prone to failure? Are Americans today destined to jump in and out of marriage? At a time when marriage at age twenty-five can mean a sixty-year active commitment, could “serial marriages” be the wave of the future? Drawing on more than sixty interviews with starter marriage veterans and on exhaustive re-search, Pamela Paul explores these questions, putting the issues into social and cultural perspective. She looks at the hopes and motivations of couples marrying today, and examines the conflict between our cultural conception of marriage and the society surrounding it. Most important, this lively and engaging narrative examines what the starter marriage trend means for the future of matrimony in this country—how and why we’ll continue to marry in the twenty-first century.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XdqHcBT0KKkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=XdqHcBT0KKkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Starter+Marriage:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XdqHcBT0KKkC&source=gbs_api	Villard	2002-04-09	{"Social Science"}	1	"The Starter Marriage" receives mixed reviews for its portrayal of a woman's journey through divorce. Positive feedback highlights the book's sensitive, perceptive take on emotional struggles, witty writing, and vividly sketched secondary characters, with humor bringing levity. Tess, the protagonist, evokes empathy and relatability. However, criticisms focus on the predictable, clichéd plot that follows a familiar "chick lit" formula, while the protagonist's characterization and superficial family interactions draw negative views. Despite these flaws, the warmth and occasional humor, especially during divorce group therapy sessions, make it an enjoyable, if unoriginal, read for fans of the genre.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Positive feedback emphasizes its innovative approach to language games and implications for everyday thinking. Some reviewers admire its depth and transformative impact on readers.

304	Chimney Swift Towers: New Habitat for America's Mysterious Birds (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)	Chimney Swifts, birds that nest and roost in chimneys, have been historically abundant in North America. But by the late 1980s, the number of swifts migrating to North America from the Amazon River Basin had declined. A growing number of people across North America are now constructing nesting towers and conducting Chimney Swift conservation projects in their own communities. With Chimney Swift Towers, concerned bird conservationists have a step-by-step guide to help them create more habitat for these beneficial, insect-eating birds. Chimney Swift experts Paul and Georgean Kyle give directions for building freestanding wooden towers, wooden kiosk towers, masonry towers, and other structures. Included are - design basics, - lists of materials needed, - useful diagrams and photographs, - and detailed instructions on site preparation, tower construction, installation, and maintenance. Anyone with basic woodworking or masonry skills and an interest in wildlife conservation will find this publication helpful. That includes do-it-yourselfers, homeowners involved in creating backyard habitat for wildlife, landscape and structural architects, park and wildscape managers, wildlife management area professionals, nature centers, garden centers, scout troops, and other civic organizations in search of community service projects.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kQFKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=kQFKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chimney+Swift+Towers:+New+Habitat+for+America%27s+Mysterious+Birds+(Louise+Lindsey+Merrick+Natural+Environment+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=kQFKDwAAQBAJ&dq=Chimney+Swift+Towers:+New+Habitat+for+America%27s+Mysterious+Birds+(Louise+Lindsey+Merrick+Natural+Environment+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api	Texas A&M University Press	2005-02-22	{Nature}	1	Kyle and Georgean's book provides comprehensive guidance on building chimney swift towers, offering various designs in wood, masonry, and cement blocks.

Many readers enjoyed the vivid action scenes, character development, and rich descriptions set during the War of the Roses. The novel's protagonist, Richard Shelton, is both flawed and believable, offering a tale filled with themes of loyalty, love, and revenge. However, the archaic language poses a barrier for some, and the disjointed narrative reflects its serialized origin.

307	Object-Oriented Design with UML and Java	Object-Oriented Design with UML and Java provides an integrated introduction to object-oriented design with the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and the Java programming language. The book demonstrates how Java applications, no matter how small, can benefit from some design during their construction. Fully road-tested by students on the authors' own courses, the book shows how these complementary technologies can be used effectively to create quality software. It requires no prior knowledge of object orientation, though readers must have some experience of Java or other high level programming language. This book covers object technology; object-oriented analysis and design; and implementation of objects with Java. It includes two case studies dealing with library applications. The UML has been incorporated into a graphical design tool called ROME, which can be downloaded from the book's website. This object modelling environment allows readers to prepare and edit various UML diagrams. ROME can be used alongside a Java compiler to generate Java code from a UML class diagram then compile and run the resulting application for hands-on learning.

311	Candy ('Tang', in traditional Chinese, NOT in English)	This book examines the development of English-translated Tang poetry and its propagation to the Western world. It consists of two parts, the first of which addresses the initial stage of English-translated Tang poetry’s propagation, and the second exploring its further development. By analyzing the historical background and characteristics of these two stages, the book traces the trend back to its roots, discusses some well-known early sinologists and their contributions, and familiarizes readers with the general course of Tang poetry’s development. In addition, it presents the translated versions of many Tang poems. The dissemination of Tang poetry to the Western world is a significant event in the history of cross-cultural communication. From the simple imitation of poetic techniques to the acceptance and identification of key poetic concepts, the Tang poetry translators gradually constructed a classic “Chinese style” in modern American poetry. Hence, the traditional Chinese culture represented by Tang poetry spread more widely in the English-speaking world, producing a more lasting impact on societies and cultures outside China – and demonstrating the poetry’s ability to transcend the boundaries of time, region, nationality and culture. Due to different cultural backgrounds, the Tang poets or poems admired most by Western readers may not necessarily receive high acclaim in China. Sometimes language barriers and cultural differences make it impossible to represent certain allusions or cultural and ethnic concepts correctly during the translation process. However, in recent decades, the translation of Tang poetry has evolved considerably in both quantity and quality. As culture is manifested in language, and language is part of culture, the translation of Tang poetry has allowed Western scholars to gain an unprecedented understanding of China and Chinese culture.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q3VQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=q3VQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183&dq=Candy+(%27Tang%27,+in+traditional+Chinese,+NOT+in+English)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q3VQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Springer	2018-03-08	{"Literary Criticism"}	4	The book "Candy" captures the fast-paced change in China through the eyes of young people, particularly focusing on a "special economic zone." The storyline follows the main character, Hong, offering a glimpse into her life and the experiences of youth during this transitional era. The narrative, which shifts between first and third-person perspectives, is praised for its poetic style and Lingenfelter's excellent translation. However, the unconventional narrative structure, with limited dialogue markers and abrupt character introductions, may challenge some readers. Overall, the book is noted for its rich descriptions and emotive prose, making it memorable for those who appreciate literary style.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
312	Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform	In this disturbing but ultimately hopeful personal account, Jean Anyon provides compelling evidence that the economic and political devastation of America's inner cities has robbed schools and teachers of the capacity to successfully implement current strategies of educational reform. She argues that without fundamental change in government and business policies and the redirection of major resources back into the schools and the communities they serve, urban schools are consigned to failure, and no effort at raising standards, improving teaching, or boosting achievement can occur. Based on her participation in an intensive four-year school reform project in the Newark, New Jersey public schools, the author vividly captures the anguish and anger of students and teachers caught in the tangle of a failing school system. Ghetto Schooling offers a penetrating historical analysis of more than a century of government and business policies that have drained the economic, political, and human resources of urban populations. Provocative and controversial, this book reveals the historical roots of the current crisis in ghetto schools and what must be done to reverse the downward spiral.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3M5lJSoDz_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=3M5lJSoDz_YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ghetto+Schooling:+A+Political+Economy+of+Urban+Educational+Reform&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=3M5lJSoDz_YC&dq=Ghetto+Schooling:+A+Political+Economy+of+Urban+Educational+Reform&hl=&source=gbs_api	Teachers College Press	1997-09-19	{Education}	1	Jean Anyon's "Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Educational Reform" critiques the systemic failures in Newark, NJ, schools, suggesting broader socioeconomic reforms are necessary for true educational improvement. The book is praised for its comprehensive historical analysis and insights into the entrenched issues of poverty and educational disparity. Readers appreciate the honest portrayal of the struggles faced by urban schools but criticize the complex prose and overwhelming statistical data. Some find Anyon's lack of a concrete reform plan disappointing, while others highlight her call for a grassroots approach addressing broader political and economic contexts as a significant takeaway.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

319	.NET Multithreading	The introduction of the Microsoft® .NET framework not only brings developers a powerful, cohesive toolset for the development of new Windows and Web applications -- it also replaces COM as the technology of choice for building components on Windows platforms. Components are the fundamental building blocks of .NET applications; they can both simplify and add flexibility to complex applications. Applied properly, component-oriented programming enable reuse, allow for long-term maintenance, application extensibility and scalability. Component technology is nothing new, but the .NET Framework offers developers a new way to develop binary components rapidly, without the hurdles that many COM developers have had to deal with prior to .NET. While retaining all of the core concepts that define component-oriented development--language independence, separation of interface from implementation, binary compatibility, versioning, concurrency management, location transparency, security, deployment--.NET is built upon a fresh component-oriented runtime that has an easier time providing these core concepts. Programming .NET Components offers a complete introduction to the new Microsoft .NET component model, focusing on the aspects of .NET that make it ideal for building reusable, maintainable, and robust components. Author Juval LÃ¶wy, a noted authority on component-oriented programming, teaches the intricacies of .NET component programming and the related system issues to application developers, along with relevant design guidelines, tips, best practices, and known pitfalls. The book is packed with helpful original utilities aimed at simplifying the programming model and increasing the developer productivity. The book begins with an appreciation for the "why" and fundamentals of component-oriented programming, and then continues with an introduction to .NET essentials. Following practical, expert advice on effective .NET development techniques, the book then devotes a chapter to each of the following features critical to component development: Resource management Versioning Events Asynchronous calls Multithreading Serialization Remoting Component services Security. Programming .NET Components offers everything you'll need to know to program components for real-life .NET applications, using Windows Forms, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, or web services. Anyone interested in developing .NET applications, especially enterprise level, will find this book an invaluable resource.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jjgx51SS95MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jjgx51SS95MC&pg=PA196&dq=.NET+Multithreading&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jjgx51SS95MC&dq=.NET+Multithreading&hl=&source=gbs_api	"O'Reilly Media, Inc."	2003-01-01	{Computers}	3	The book ".NET Multithreading" has received mixed reviews.

324	A Recursive Vision: Ecological Understanding and Gregory Bateson	Gregory Bateson was one of the most original social scientists of this century. He is widely known as author of key ideas used in family therapy - including the well-known condition called 'double bind' . He was also one of the most influential figures in cultural anthropology. In the decade before his death in 1980 Bateson turned toward a consideration of ecology. Standard ecology concentrates on an ecosystem's biomass and on energy budgets supporting life. Bateson came to the conclusion that understanding ecological organization requires a complete switch in scientific perspective. He reasoned that ecological phenomena must be explained primarily through patterns of information and that only through perceiving these informational patterns will we uncover the elusive unity, or integration, of ecosystems. Bateson believed that relying upon the materialist framework of knowledge dominant in ecological science will deepen errors of interpretation and, in the end, promote eco-crisis. He saw recursive patterns of communication as the basis of order in both natural and human domains. He conducted his investigation first in small-scale social settings; then among octopus, otters, and dolphins. Later he took these investigations to the broader setting of evolutionary analysis and developed a framework of thinking he called 'an ecology of mind.' Finally, his inquiry included an ecology of mind in ecological settings - a recursive epistemology. This is the first study of the whole range of Bateson's ecological thought - a comprehensive presentaionof Bateson's matrix of ideas. Drawing on unpublished letters and papers, Harries-Jones clarifies themes scattered throughout Bateson's own writings, revealing the conceptual consistency inherent in Bateson's position, and elaborating ways in which he pioneered aspects of late twentieth-century thought.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m4lQrfqt46gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=m4lQrfqt46gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Recursive+Vision:+Ecological+Understanding+and+Gregory+Bateson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=m4lQrfqt46gC&dq=A+Recursive+Vision:+Ecological+Understanding+and+Gregory+Bateson&hl=&source=gbs_api	University of Toronto Press	1995-01-01	{Philosophy}	1	The book offers a deep dive into ecological and scientific concepts, emphasizing the importance of an ecological worldview for informed decision-making regarding resource use.

330	Just Another Soldier: A Year on the Ground in Iraq	This is not your father's war This is Iraq, where a soldier's first duty is reinforcing his Humvee with sheet metal and sand bags. Or, in the absence of plumbing, burning barrels of human waste. Where any dead dog on the side of the road might be concealing an insurgent's bomb and anyone could be the enemy. At age 17, Jason Christopher Hartley joined the Army National Guard. Thirteen years later, he is called to active duty, to serve in Iraq. Sent to a town called Ad Dujayl, made notorious by Saddam Hussein's 1982 massacre, Hartley is thrust into the center of America's war against terrorism. This is his story. "If you are distrustful of the media and want to know exactly what's going on in Iraq, you'll have to pray for divine enlightenment, because only god knows what the hell is going on over here. However, if you want to know how it feels to be a soldier in Iraq, to hear something honest and raw, that I can help you with." Sometimes profane, often poignant, and always nakedly candid, Just Another Soldier takes the reader past the images seen on CNN and the nightly news, into the day to day reality of life on the ground as an infantryman, attached to the 1st Division, in the first war of the 21st century. From the adrenaline rush of storming a suspected insurgent's house, to the sheer boredom of down time on the base, to the horror of dead civilians, Hartley examines his role as a man, as a soldier and as an American on foreign soil. His quest to discover the balance between his compassionate side and his baser instincts, results in a searing portrait of today's Army and a remarkable personal narrative written in a fresh and exciting new voice. Just Another Soldier is more than a war story; it delivers an intimate look at a generation of young men and women on the front lines of American policy. Whether you're for or against the war in Iraq, this is essential reading.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=umUobe6t5BEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=umUobe6t5BEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Just+Another+Soldier:+A+Year+on+the+Ground+in+Iraq&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=umUobe6t5BEC&source=gbs_api	Harper Collins	2009-03-17	{"Political Science"}	1	The reviews collectively praise Jason Christopher Hartley's book for its authentic portrayal of a soldier's experience in Iraq, with particular emphasis on the humor, candidness, and realism Hartley brings to his narrative.

336	Just Another Kid	"Just Another Kid is not just another book. This remarkable teacher's memoir reminds us that love takes many forms." -The New York Times From the bestselling author of One Child comes the true story of six children impossible to reach and the amazing teacher who embraced them all. Torey Hayden faced six emotionally troubled kids no other teacher could handle—three recent arrivals from battle-torn Northern Ireland, badly traumatized by the horrors of war; eleven-year-old Dirkie, who only knew of life inside an institution; excitable Mariana, aggressive and sexually precocious at the age of eight; and seven-year-old Leslie, perhaps the most hopeless of all, unresponsive and unable to speak. With compassion, rare insight, and masterful storytelling, teacher Torey Hayden once again touches our hearts with her account of the miracles that can happen in her class of “special” children.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m_3uvQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=m_3uvQAACAAJ&dq=Just+Another+Kid&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=m_3uvQAACAAJ&dq=Just+Another+Kid&hl=&source=gbs_api	William Morrow Paperbacks	2017-05-23	{"Family & Relationships"}	5	Torey Hayden's book "Just Another Kid" receives overwhelmingly positive feedback for its engaging storytelling and emotional depth, highlighting her talent as a special education teacher and writer. Readers appreciate her compassionate portrayal of special needs children and her ability to build empathy for her teaching assistant, Ladbrooke, whose struggles with alcoholism and personal issues are central to the story. Despite some criticism that the book focuses too much on Ladbrooke instead of the children, many find this perspective adds depth and resonance. While some object to the inclusion of vulgar language, most find Hayden's book inspiring, transformative, and a valuable read for educators and parents alike.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
337	Oil Field Chemicals	Oil field chemicals are gaining increasing importance, as the resources of crude oil are decreasing. An increasing demand of more sophisticated methods in the exploitation of the natural resources emerges for this reason. This book reviews the progress in the area of oil field chemicals and additives of the last decade from a rather chemical view. The material presented is a compilation from the literature by screening critically approximately 20,000 references. The text is ordered according to applications, just in the way how the jobs are emerging in practice. It starts with drilling, goes to productions and ends with oil spill. Several chemicals are used in multiple disciplines, and to those separate chapters are devoted. Two index registers are available, an index of chemical substances and a general index. * Gives an introduction to the chemically orientated petroleum engineer. * Provides the petroleum engineer involved with research and development with a quick reference tool. * Covers interdisciplinary matter, i.e. connects petroleum recovery and handling with chemical aspects.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lT9uQBIc4_8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=lT9uQBIc4_8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Oil+Field+Chemicals&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lT9uQBIc4_8C&source=gbs_api	Elsevier	2003-08-19	{"Technology & Engineering"}	2	The book "Oil Field Chemicals" receives criticism for its superficial treatment of the topic, offering generalizations and mere lists of chemicals without in-depth analysis or insights into chemical interactions.

The author, James O'Toole, effectively translates Aristotle's philosophies on ethics, happiness, and financial planning into contemporary language, integrating personal stories to make the concepts accessible. Positive feedback highlights the book's clarity and practical approach, making complex philosophical ideas easy to understand. However, criticism points to the limited demographic scope of examples, focusing mainly on wealthy, older white men, which diminishes its broader applicability.

339	Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy against America	T he present work, the result of some forty years of investigative research, is a logical progression from my previous books: the expose of the international control of monetary issue and banking practices in the United States; a later work revealing the secret network of organizations through which these alien forces wield political power-the secret committees, foundations, and political parties through which their hidden plans are implemented; and now; to the most vital issue of all, the manner in which these depredations affect the daily lives and health of American citizens. Despite the great power of the hidden rulers, I found that only one group has the power to issue life or death sentences to any American-our nation's physicians. I discovered that these physicians, despite their great power, were themselves subjected to very strict controls over every aspect of their professional lives. These controls, surprisingly enough, were not wielded by any state or federal agency, although almost every other aspect of American life is now under the absolute control of the bureaucracy. The physicians have their own autocracy, a private trade association, the American Medical Association. This group, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, had gradually built up its power until it assumed total control over medical schools and the accreditation of physicians. The trail of these manipulators led me straight to the same lairs of the international conspirators whom I had exposed in previous books. I knew that they had already looted America, reduced its military power to a dangerously low level, and imposed bureaucratic controls on every American. I now discovered that their conspiracies also directly affected the health of every American. This conspiracy has resulted in a documented decline in the health of our citizens. We now rank far down the list of civilized nations in infant mortality and other significant medical statistics. I was able to document the shocking record of these cold-blooded tycoons who not only plan and carry out famines, economic depressions, revolutions and wars, but who also find their greatest profits in their manipulations of our medical care. The cynicism and malice of these conspirators is something beyond the imagination of most Americans. They deliberately mulct our people of millions of dollars each year through ''charitable'' organizations and then use these same organizations as key groups to bolster their Medical Monopoly. Fear and intimidation are the basic techniques by which the conspirators maintain their control over all aspects of our health care, as they ruthlessly crush any competitor who challenges their profits. As in other aspects of their ''behavioural control'' over the American people, their most constantly used weapon against us is their employment of federal agents and federal agencies to carry out their intrigues. The proof of this operation may be the most disturbing revelation of my work.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+by+Injection:+The+Story+of+the+Medical+Conspiracy+against+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+by+Injection:+The+Story+of+the+Medical+Conspiracy+against+America&hl=&source=gbs_api	NaN	2016-04-21	{Medical}	1	Eustace Mullins' "Murder By Injection" is highly praised by readers for its detailed research into the American and Western medical establishments, drawing parallels with his earlier work on the Federal Reserve. The book is lauded for exposing how monopolistic interests, especially the Rockefellers, have allegedly corrupted the healthcare system for profit, prioritizing allopathic over homeopathic medicine, and limiting treatment options. It criticizes the FDA, AMA, and pharmaceutical companies for prioritizing profit through deceptive practices and high costs. While readers appreciate Mullins' thorough documentation, some personal anecdotes reflect negative healthcare experiences, echoing the book's critique of the medical profession's profit motives.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
340	Arthur Ashe on Tennis	A childhood biography of a groundbreaking African-American athlete. Arthur Ashe (1943-1993) was the first African American man to win a major tennis tournament. He did not start out with a love of the game--his favorite sport was actually baseball--but growing up in the racist south, Arthur decided he would one day play sports on courts that did not allow black athletes. After proving himself a natural on the tennis court, and struggling with committing to the game, Arthur enjoyed many years of championship tennis, crowned by two achievements: his victory over Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon, and competing in Byrd Park, Virginia, a park he was not allowed to play in when he was a child. Alas, during heart surgery in 1983, it is likely that Ashe was given blood tainted with HIV. He became an active fundraiser and speaker on behalf of AIDS research. In 1997 the U.S. Tennis Center's main stadium in New York City was named Arthur Ashe Stadium in honor of his many contributions to the game. This inspiring biography showcases Ashe's courage in the face of bigotry.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kq0zfB2yxGAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Kq0zfB2yxGAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Arthur+Ashe+on+Tennis&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kq0zfB2yxGAC&source=gbs_api	Simon and Schuster	2012-03-13	{"Juvenile Nonfiction"}	1	The book offers solid tennis advice comparable to Brad Gilbert's but with a less humorous tone.

On the positive side, a counselor from San Diego praises it for its insightful analysis of dysfunctional relationships and strongly recommends it, especially for those dealing with repeated failed or abusive partnerships. In contrast, a critical review describes the book as outdated, poorly written, and repetitive, with excessive reliance on old references. The reviewer finds its message—that men can't change and it's up to women to adapt—offensive and suggests an alternative book by Deborah Tannen. Despite noting a slight positive aspect, the reviewer is largely disappointed and questions the book’s educational value.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

It provides a practical approach and includes information on ISO 9000 standards. However, the book is criticized for its redundancy, lack of historical context, and insufficient theory on FMEA, making it unsuitable as an introductory text. Some readers find it overpriced and too lengthy. While appreciated for its practical tools and summaries of mathematical formulae, it assumes prior knowledge of FMEA. Alternatively, "The Basics of FMEA" by McDermott et al. is recommended for beginners.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world’s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a “super coral” that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jiHzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=jiHzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=UNDER+A+NEW+SKY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=jiHzDwAAQBAJ&dq=UNDER+A+NEW+SKY&hl=&source=gbs_api	Crown	2021-02-09	{Science}	8	This book provides a vivid and emotionally captivating portrayal of Russia, offering readers a deep understanding of the country.

352	Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension	Already thoroughly familiar to the seasoned science fiction fan, hyperspace is that realm which enables a spaceship captain to take his ship on a physics-defying shortcut (or "wormhole") to the outer shores of the Galaxy in less time than it takes a 747 to fly from New York to Tokyo. But might such notions be more than science fiction? Some physicists suggest a 10-dimensional hyperspace may actually exist, albeit at a scale almost too small to comprehend, smaller even than a quark; and that in spite of its tiny size, it may be the basis on which all the forces of nature will be united. Michio Kaku's classic book describes the development of ideas about multidimensional space. In recent years, some theoretical physicists -the author among them - have argued that the Universe exists not merely in the four spacetime dimensions (3 of space + one of time) with which Einstein made us familiar, but rather as a ten-dimensional hyperspace. Once the domain of the science fiction writer or the occultist, hyperspace may, according to superstring theorists, be the way to unify the fundamental forces of nature - Einstein's unfulfilled dream of a theory of everything. Michio Kaku takes the reader on a ride through hyperspace to the edge of physics. On the way he gives crystal clear explanations of such formidable mathematical concepts as non-Euclidean geometry, Kaluza-Klein Theory, and Supergravity, the everyday tools of the string theorist. Utilizing fascinating and often hilarious anecdotes from history, art, and science fiction, Kaku shows us that writers and artists - in addition to scientists - have been fascinated by multidimensional space for over a century. Finally, Kaku proposes that the ability to master hyperspace may be our only salvation from destruction at the end of spacetime. Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must-read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nJNNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=nJNNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hyperspace:+A+Scientific+Odyssey+through+Parallel+Universes,+Time+Warps,+and+the+Tenth+Dimension&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nJNNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Oxford University Press	2018-02-23	{Science}	5	"Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku is a compelling exploration of complex physics theories made accessible to the general reader. It covers superstring theory, higher dimensions, and the quest for a unified theory of everything, using clear analogies and engaging narratives.

"Following on the successes of two previous dictionary projects, the CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names and the CRC World Dictionary of the Grasses, Umberto Quattrocchi has undertaken this dictionary of economically important plants.... He has done for these plants what was so admirably done in his other works—brought the vast and scattered literature on plant names, and in this case, too, their uses, into coherent order so that the inquisitive scholar can get a foothold." —From the Foreword, Donald H. Pfister, Harvard University and Harvard University Herbaria, Cambridge, Massachusetts The CRC World Dictionary of Medicinal and Poisonous Plants: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology provides the starting point for better access to data on plants used around the world in medicine, food, and cultural practices. The material found in the five volumes has been painstakingly gathered from papers of general interest, reports and records, taxonomic revisions, field studies, herbaria and herbarium collections, notes, monographs, pamphlets, botanical literature, and literature tout court. It includes sources available at various natural history libraries, floras and standard flora works, local floras and local histories, nomenclatural histories, and the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Much more than a dictionary, the book provides the names of thousands of genera and species of economically important plants, concise summaries of plant properties, and appropriate observations about medicinal uses. Drawing from a tremendous range of primary and secondary sources, it is an indispensable time-saving guide for all those involved with botany, herbal medicine, pharmacognosy, toxicology, medicinal and natural product chemistry, and agriculture.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YC_lAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=YC_lAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2787&dq=A+CHECKLIST+OF+THE+TREES,+SHRUBS,+HERBS,+AND+CLIMBERS+OF+MYANMAR+(CONTRIBUTIONS+FROM+THE+UNITED+STATES+NATIONAL+HERBARIUM,+VOLUME+45:+1-590).&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=YC_lAgAAQBAJ&dq=A+CHECKLIST+OF+THE+TREES,+SHRUBS,+HERBS,+AND+CLIMBERS+OF+MYANMAR+(CONTRIBUTIONS+FROM+THE+UNITED+STATES+NATIONAL+HERBARIUM,+VOLUME+45:+1-590).&hl=&source=gbs_api	CRC Press	2012-05-03	{Science}	3	The checklist serves as a valuable resource for those interested in Myanmar's flora, featuring photos of local plants, including gingers.

367	Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World	This powerful account of the oppression of women in the Muslim world remains as shocking today as when it was first published, more than a quarter of a century ago. Nawal El Saadawi writes out of a powerful sense of the violence and injustice which permeated her society. Her experiences working as a doctor in villages around Egypt, witnessing prostitution, honour killings and sexual abuse, including female circumcision, drove her to give voice to this suffering. She goes on explore the causes of the situation through a discussion of the historical role of Arab women in religion and literature. Saadawi argues that the veil, polygamy and legal inequality are incompatible with the essence of Islam or any human faith. This edition, complete with a new foreword, lays claim to The Hidden Face of Eve's status as a classic of modern Arab writing.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u5n9zUZuVI8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=u5n9zUZuVI8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hidden+Face+of+Eve:+Women+in+the+Arab+World&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=u5n9zUZuVI8C&dq=Hidden+Face+of+Eve:+Women+in+the+Arab+World&hl=&source=gbs_api	Zed Books	2007-06-01	{"Social Science"}	3	Nawal Al-Sa'Dawi's "The Hidden Face of Eve" is essential for understanding feminism, particularly within Islamic and post-colonial contexts. Written in the 1970s, it remains relevant for its exploration of enduring patriarchal practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM), which Sa'Dawi condemns. The book is a collection of essays that often feel standalone, focusing on personal and observed experiences rather than statistical data. Readers praise Sa'Dawi's firsthand insights and scholarly approach, though some critique her for the anecdotal nature of her evidence. The book is valued for its critical analysis of cultural norms and Sa'Dawi’s activism despite political repression.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

369	The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums	The story begins, as stories do in all good thrillers, with a botched robbery and a police chase. Eight Apuleian vases of the fourth century B.C. are discovered in the swimming pool of a German-based art smuggler. More valuable than the recovery of the vases, however, is the discovery of the smuggler's card index detailing his deals and dealers. It reveals the existence of a web of tombaroli—tomb raiders— who steal classical artifacts, and a network of dealers and smugglers who spirit them out of Italy and into the hands of wealthy collectors and museums. Peter Watson, a former investigative journalist for the London Sunday Times and author of two previous exposés of art world scandals, names the key figures in this network that has depleted Europe's classical artifacts. Among the loot are the irreplaceable and highly collectable vases of Euphronius, the equivalent in their field of the sculpture of Bernini or the painting of Michelangelo. The narrative leads to the doors of some major institutions: Sothebys, the Getty Museum in L.A., the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York among them. Filled with great characters and human drama, The Medici Conspiracy authoritatively exposes another shameful round in one of the oldest games in the world: theft, smuggling and duplicitous dealing, all in the name of art.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cElqswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=cElqswEACAAJ&dq=The+Medici+Conspiracy:+The+Illicit+Journey+of+Looted+Antiquities--From+Italy%27s+Tomb+Raiders+to+the+World%27s+Greatest+Museums&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=cElqswEACAAJ&dq=The+Medici+Conspiracy:+The+Illicit+Journey+of+Looted+Antiquities--From+Italy%27s+Tomb+Raiders+to+the+World%27s+Greatest+Museums&hl=&source=gbs_api	PublicAffairs	2007-06-12	{Art}	2	"The Medici Conspiracy" by Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini is a compelling exploration of the illicit trade in looted antiquities, focusing on the notorious activities of dealer Giacomo Medici. The book is praised for its thorough research, accessible style, and ability to bring the narrative to life. It reveals the complicity of prestigious institutions like the Getty and Metropolitan Museum of Art in the looting scandal.

395	The men in blue: Conversations with umpires	The philosopher Jacques Barzun thought that "whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball." And whoever wants to know baseball had better learn about umpires. As Larry Gerlach points out in The Men in Blue, these arbiters transform competitive chaos into organized sport. They make it possible to "play ball," but nobody loves them. Considering the abuse meted out by fans and players, why would any sane person want to be an umpire? Many reasons emerge in conversations with a dozen former major league arbiters. While nobody loves them, they love the game. Gerlach has elicited entertaining stories from these figures under fire--about their lonely travels, their dealings with umpire baiters, battles for unionization, breaking through the color line, and much more. From Beans Reardon, who came up to the National League in 1926, to Ed Sudol, who retired in 1977, here is a witty and telling portrait of baseball from the boisterous Golden Age to the Jet Age of Instant Replay.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EbKibRAz7TUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=EbKibRAz7TUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+men+in+blue:+Conversations+with+umpires&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=EbKibRAz7TUC&dq=The+men+in+blue:+Conversations+with+umpires&hl=&source=gbs_api	U of Nebraska Press	1994-01-01	{"Sports & Recreation"}	2	Larry Gerlach's "Men In Blue" is a compelling account of the experiences of major league baseball umpires, spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s. Reviews praise the book for its rich anecdotes, engaging prose, and insightful behind-the-scenes look at umpiring, which enhances respect for the profession and the game itself. Readers appreciated stories about legendary players like Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio, and found the book both entertaining and educational. However, some noted the writing can feel dry at times, and the content may appear dated.

Munson	Grape Man of Texas is the first biography of Thomas Volney Munson (1843-1913), the internationally known horticulturist who developed over 300 varieties of new grapes specifically for the American South and Southwest. He is perhaps best known for his work in fighting the phylloxera epidemic of the late nineteenth century, which nearly wiped out the world's vineyards. His solution-grafting vinifera onto certain resistant native rootstocks from Texas-earned him the Chevalier du Merite Agricole in the French Legion of Honor and numerous accolades. Munson belonged to and was honored by a number of viticultural and scientific associations and was considered a leader in the new scientific movement of the time for his cutting-edge work in breeding plant varieties, some of which are still important in modern viticulture and research.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E9xJAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=E9xJAAAAYAAJ&q=Grape+Man+of+Texas:+The+Life+of+T.V.+Munson&dq=Grape+Man+of+Texas:+The+Life+of+T.V.+Munson&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=E9xJAAAAYAAJ&dq=Grape+Man+of+Texas:+The+Life+of+T.V.+Munson&hl=&source=gbs_api	NaN	2004-01-01	{Science}	1	"Grape Man Of Texas" is a biography of Thomas V.

408	A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles	Controversies in politics arise from many sources, but the conflicts that endure for generations or centuries show a remarkably consistent pattern. In this classic work, Thomas Sowell analyzes this pattern. He describes the two competing visions that shape our debates about the nature of reason, justice, equality, and power: the "constrained" vision, which sees human nature as unchanging and selfish, and the "unconstrained" vision, in which human nature is malleable and perfectible. A Conflict of Visions offers a convincing case that ethical and policy disputes circle around the disparity between both outlooks.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TYQ5DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=TYQ5DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Conflict+of+Visions:+Ideological+Origins+of+Political+Struggles&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TYQ5DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Hachette UK	2007-06-05	{Philosophy}	7	Thomas Sowell’s book "A Conflict of Visions" explores the ideological divide between what he terms the "constrained" and "unconstrained" visions. The constrained vision sees human nature as flawed and emphasizes traditions, systemic processes, and the necessity of trade-offs. In contrast, the unconstrained vision is optimistic about human perfectibility and stresses the role of reason and moral good in achieving social justice and equality. Reviews praise Sowell’s thorough and balanced analysis, acknowledging his ability to remain objective despite his conservative leanings. However, some criticize the book for being overly academic and repetitive. Overall, readers find it insightful in understanding the roots of political and social disagreements.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

418	Black Series: Poems	In her remarkable Black Series, Laurie Sheck turns the ordinary world inside out and shows us its glittering seams. Her long, elegantly quizzical lines convey a haunted vision of human striving which is in part an elaboration on our daily reality, and in part a fantastic departure from it. “I can almost taste the glassy air,” she writes. “Where are the birds in it, / wings lifting as currents buffet them like echoes, bright / chaos of atomized instances . . . ?” Roaming freely in the shifting landscape of the imagination, Sheck delivers an inner life that is just as vivid as what we see around us; at the same time, she shows us what we see in a new light, bringing illumination even to darkness: It’s the black night that wakes in me, so dominant, so focused. And then a car goes by and I think, “I’m in the world,” tires kicking up gravel from the dust. What does the orange hawkweed do inside this dark–its radiance secretive but not extinguished? To read this collection is to discover at every turn that secretive but undeniable radiance, and a language that is both riveting and distinctive.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qKXXyHjOHrQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=qKXXyHjOHrQC&pg=PT2&dq=Black+Series:+Poems&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qKXXyHjOHrQC&source=gbs_api	Knopf	2012-06-27	{Poetry}	2	Laurie Sheck's latest poetry collection is praised for its vivid imagery and exploration of diverse themes, from urban life to ancient subjects like Medusa and Pompeii.

420	Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years	Reelin’ in the Years tell the remarkable story of the American jazz rock band who have sold over 50 million albums during a career lasting over 20 years: Steely Dan. Updated and revised for 2018. Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, a couple of cynical New York jazz fans wormed their way into a record contract and astonished critics with their first album Can't Buy a Thrill in 1973. Nine albums later, they were among the biggest selling acts in the world. Steely Dan were different from the rest of rock's super-sellers. They rarely gave interviews and, after some early bad experiences on the road, they refused to tour. They didn't have their photographs taken and few people knew what they looked like. Steely Dan weren’t even a proper group; it was two musicians and a producer, yet every top notch player in the world lined up to appear on their albums. This book, penned by Brian Sweet, the editor and publisher of Metal Leg, the UK-based Steely Dan fanzine, finally draws back the veil of secrecy that surrounded Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Here is the story of how they made their music and lived their lives.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5BRhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=5BRhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steely+Dan:+Reelin%27+in+the+Years&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5BRhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Omnibus Press	2018-08-16	{Music}	1	Brian Sweet's book "Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years" offers an unauthorized biography of Steely Dan's Walter Becker and Donald Fagen.

The lack of an index and bibliography further detracts from its utility as a reliable reference, disappointing some fans seeking a more insightful account.

423	Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys	The stunning success of Reviving Ophelia, Mary Pipher’s landmark book, showed a true and pressing need to address the emotional lives of girls. Now, finally, here is the book that answers our equally timely and critical need to understand our boys. In Raising Cain, Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., two of the country’s leading child psychologists, share what they have learned in more than thirty-five years of combined experience working with boys and their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting—sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Statistics point to an alarming number of young boys at high risk for suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, violence and loneliness. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they’re not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that “cool” equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of “mother blame,” “boy biology,” and "testosterone,” Kindlon and Thompson shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive—the emotional miseducation of boys. Through moving case studies and cutting-edge research, Raising Cain paints a portrait of boys systematically steered away from their emotional lives by adults and the peer “culture of cruelty”—boys who receive little encouragement to develop qualities such as compassion, sensitivity, and warmth. The good news is that this doesn't have to happen. There is much we can do to prevent it. Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy—giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth. Powerfully written and deeply felt, Raising Cain will forever change the way we see our sons and will transform the way we help them to become happy and fulfilled young men.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2D0OQAGV96kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=2D0OQAGV96kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Raising+Cain:+Protecting+the+Emotional+Life+of+Boys&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2D0OQAGV96kC&source=gbs_api	Ballantine Books	2009-08-05	{"Family & Relationships"}	6	"Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys" receives mixed feedback, highlighting its insight into the challenges boys face and their need for emotional support.

426	Death in the Afternoon	Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and “the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick.” Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning. A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AdFQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=AdFQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Death+in+the+Afternoon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AdFQAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Simon and Schuster	2014-05-22	{"Literary Criticism"}	9	Ernest Hemingway's "Death in the Afternoon" provides an intricate exploration of the art and tradition of bullfighting.

443	Give Your Dog a Bone: The Practical Commonsense Way to Feed Dogs for a Long Healthy Life	Dr. Billinghurst's most important piece of writing is the book Give Your Dog a Bone. Because cats and dogs have different food requirements, (cats are obligate carnivores while dogs are omnivores with a carnivorous background), he decided they each needed their own book, and that he would write the dog book first. Thus was born Give Your Dog a Bone. This book was launched at a 3 day Bichon Frise conference in western Sydney on the 17th November 1993. The book was advertised in all the canine breeder magazines throughout Australia. Give Your Dog a Bone? proved an instant hit, with many breeders adopting its ideas. Since that time it has been making steady inroads into the minds of breeders and dog owners throughout Australia and overseas. To date nearly fifty thousand copies of this book have been sold. Give Your Dog a Bone is the book that began the worldwide BARF dietary revolution for pets and remains 'the book' to read on the subject of BARF. It remains the practical common sense way to feed any dog for a long healthy life. It is the only book available that deals exclusively with feeding dogs their natural or evolutionary diet. This book contains vital information for all dog owners. It is a must for the owners of new puppies. Its 320 pages are packed with practical authoritative dog feeding advice that will drastically reduce vet bills. It shows that a dog's diet, which is based on raw meaty bones, is simple to produce, promotes health and is inexpensive. Give Your Dog a Bone explains why processed foods are the major cause of growth, reproductive, dental and most of the degenerative diseases including problems such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure, cardiac disease, the auto-immune diseases etc.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zUnEAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=zUnEAAAACAAJ&dq=Give+Your+Dog+a+Bone:+The+Practical+Commonsense+Way+to+Feed+Dogs+for+a+Long+Healthy+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=zUnEAAAACAAJ&dq=Give+Your+Dog+a+Bone:+The+Practical+Commonsense+Way+to+Feed+Dogs+for+a+Long+Healthy+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api	Warrigal Publishing	1993-01-01	{Cooking}	2	Dr. Ian Billinghurst's book on the BARF (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) diet for dogs has received mixed feedback.

448	Love is...a Wild Ride!	Major Garrett has been reporting on the White House for nearly two decades, covering four different presidencies for three news outlets. But if he thought that his distinguished journalistic career had prepared him for the unique challenges of covering Donald Trump, he was in for a surprise. Like many others in Washington, Garrett found himself having to unlearn many of his own settled notions about the nature and function of the presidency. He also had to separate the carnival-like noise of the Trump presidency from its underlying substance. For even in its first half, Trump’s tenure has been highly consequential. In Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride, Major Garrett provides what journalists are often said to do, but usually don’t: a true first draft of history. His goal was to sift through the mountains of distracting tweets and shrieking headlines in order to focus on the most significant moments of Trump’s young presidency, the ones that Garrett believes will have a lasting impact. The result is an authoritative, mature, and consistently entertaining account of one of the strangest eras in American political history. A consummate professional with unimpeachable integrity, remarkable storytelling skills, and a deep knowledge of his subject earned through decades of experience, Garrett brings to life the twists and turns of covering this White House and its unconventional occupant with wit, sagacity and style. Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride should place him securely in the first rank of Washington journalists.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nHtJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=nHtJDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=Love+is...a+Wild+Ride!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nHtJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	All Points Books	2018-09-18	{"Political Science"}	2	The reviewed book is a small, cute, and well-loved collection of Kim Casali's "Love is..." cartoons, reminiscent of those from the 70s.

Interpreting the calling cards of the serial murderer, Robert Keppel reveals the answers hidden among the grisly evidence, the common threads that link each devastating act of brutal violence.

454	Rescuing the Spectacled Bear (BBC Audio)	The angry grizzly and the cuddly teddy: few animals possess such a range of personas as the bear. Here, Robert Bieder surveys the wealth of imagery, myths, and stories that surrounds the bear. Beginning with the dawn bear, the small dog-sized ancestor of all bears who hails from 25 million years ago, Bieder embarks on a fascinating exploration of the evolutionary history of the bear family, from extinct species such as the cave bear and giant short-faced bear to the mere eight species that survive today. Bear draws on cultural material from around the world to examine the various legends and myths surrounding the bear, including ceremonies and taboos that govern the hunting, killing, and eating of bears. The book also looks at the role of bears in modern culture as the subjects of stories, songs, and films; as exhibited objects in circuses and zoos; and, perhaps most famously, as toys. Bieder also considers the precarious future of the bear as it is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching, global warming, and disease and discusses the impact of human behavior on bears and their environments. Accompanied by numerous vibrant photographs and illustrations, and written in an engaging fashion, Bear is an appealing and informative volume for anyone who has curled up with Winnie-the-Pooh or marveled at this powerful king of the forest.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YX_xAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=YX_xAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT141&dq=Rescuing+the+Spectacled+Bear+(BBC+Audio)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YX_xAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	Reaktion Books	2005-08-18	{Nature}	1	This book offers a touching and mildly gritty story about overcoming bureaucracy to save bears, featuring plenty of great pictures.

458	The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible	Many commentators and users of the Bible have, over the centuries and up to the present day, used the Bible to argue that animals have no rights, that they were put on this earth for our use, and that we have no obligations to them. In his cogent, honest, and fully researched and referenced work, The Dominion of Love, Norm Phelps attempts to encourage all who revere the Bible as holy scripture to open their hearts to the suffering that we inflict upon our nonhuman neighbors. He shows that the right of animals not to be imprisoned, harmed, and killed for our benefit flows naturally from the Bible's message of love and compassion and argues that this is the message of the Bible's most important passages dealing with our relationship to animals. He further responds to the defenses of animal exploitation that are often made based on the Bible. Beautifully written, The Dominion of Love is an essential addition to a growing body of literature that argues for a compassionate and non-exploitative reading of Holy Scripture.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Lfn3NrjUZ2wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lfn3NrjUZ2wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Dominion+of+Love:+Animal+Rights+According+to+the+Bible&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lfn3NrjUZ2wC&dq=The+Dominion+of+Love:+Animal+Rights+According+to+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api	Lantern Books	2002-01-01	{Nature}	2	"The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible" by Norm Phelps is generally well-received for its persuasive argument that the Bible can support animal rights through a focus on love and compassion.

469	Modern American usage: A guide	Since first appearing in 1998, Garner's Modern American Usage has established itself as the preeminent guide to the effective use of the English language. Brimming with witty, erudite essays on troublesome words and phrases, GMAU authoritatively shows how to avoid the countless pitfalls that await unwary writers and speakers whether the issues relate to grammar, punctuation, word choice, or pronunciation. An exciting new feature of this third edition is Garner's Language-Change Index, which registers where each disputed usage in modern English falls on a five-stage continuum from nonacceptability (to the language community as a whole) to acceptability, giving the book a consistent standard throughout. GMAU is the first usage guide ever to incorporate such a language-change index. The judgments are based both on Garner's own original research in linguistic corpora and on his analysis of hundreds of earlier studies. Another first in this edition is the panel of critical readers: 120-plus commentators who have helped Garner reassess and update the text, so that every page has been improved. Bryan A. Garner is a writer, grammarian, lexicographer, teacher, and lawyer. He has written professionally about English usage for more than 28 years, and his work has achieved widespread renown. David Foster Wallace proclaimed that Bryan Garner is a genius and William Safire called the book excellent. In fact, due to the strength of his work on GMAU, Garner was the grammarian asked to write the grammar-and-usage chapter for the venerable Chicago Manual of Style. His advice on language matters is second to none.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Modern+American+usage:+A+guide&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C&dq=Modern+American+usage:+A+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api	Oxford University Press, USA	2009-07-28	{"Language Arts & Disciplines"}	2	Wensberg's revision of Follett's esteemed guide to Modern American Usage garners both praise and criticism. Positively, the guide is recognized for its readability, stylistic guidance, and enjoyable writing. It offers a convenient cross-referencing system and updates to Follett’s original work, making it engaging and accessible for contemporary readers. Some reviewers appreciate the book's prescriptive approach and its organization, which aids writers in achieving clarity and confidence. Negatively, there are criticisms of incomplete entries, lack of thoroughness, absence of an index, and inconsistency in following its own prescriptive rules. Comparisons to Fowler’s guide note Follett’s less comprehensive, yet more accessible nature.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
470	Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (2nd Edition)	For more than twenty years, serious C programmers have relied on one book for practical, in-depth knowledge of the programming interfaces that drive the UNIX and Linux kernels: W. Richard Stevens’ Advanced Programming in the UNIX® Environment . Now, once again, Rich’s colleague Steve Rago has thoroughly updated this classic work. The new third edition supports today’s leading platforms, reflects new technical advances and best practices, and aligns with Version 4 of the Single UNIX Specification. Steve carefully retains the spirit and approach that have made this book so valuable. Building on Rich’s pioneering work, he begins with files, directories, and processes, carefully laying the groundwork for more advanced techniques, such as signal handling and terminal I/O. He also thoroughly covers threads and multithreaded programming, and socket-based IPC. This edition covers more than seventy new interfaces, including POSIX asynchronous I/O, spin locks, barriers, and POSIX semaphores. Most obsolete interfaces have been removed, except for a few that are ubiquitous. Nearly all examples have been tested on four modern platforms: Solaris 10, Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Darwin 10.8.0), FreeBSD 8.0, and Ubuntu version 12.04 (based on Linux 3.2). As in previous editions, you’ll learn through examples, including more than ten thousand lines of downloadable, ISO C source code. More than four hundred system calls and functions are demonstrated with concise, complete programs that clearly illustrate their usage, arguments, and return values. To tie together what you’ve learned, the book presents several chapter-length case studies, each reflecting contemporary environments. Advanced Programming in the UNIX® Environment has helped generations of programmers write code with exceptional power, performance, and reliability. Now updated for today’s systems, this third edition will be even more valuable.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kCTMFpEcIOwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=kCTMFpEcIOwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Advanced+Programming+in+the+UNIX+Environment+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kCTMFpEcIOwC&source=gbs_api	Addison-Wesley	2013-06-10	{Computers}	6	The updated edition of "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" retains the detailed format of the original, addressing changes in UNIX since 1992, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. The book is a valuable reference for system-level programming in C/C++, not a fundamental UNIX or C/C++ tutorial. It retains core chapters with minimal changes but adds new chapters on threads, reflecting their importance. The book includes rich examples, projects, and exercises, though some code may need adaptation for modern systems. Users praise its comprehensiveness and utility for UNIX programming, despite some complaints about outdated code for Linux. Overall, it's highly recommended for UNIX programmers.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

475	In search of Scotland	A book by H. V. Morton is more than a travel book: it is a sensitive interpretation of a country's people and their history. The success of his first book on England, established the popularity of something new and refreshing in this type of literature. Mr Morton's travels have gained him thousands of readers in all parts of the world. The author has frequently been requested to define the secret of writing a travel book. He always replies: 'There is no secret. You either enjoy yourself or you do not. If you do, say so; if you do not - say so!' This disarming sincerity is, perhaps, responsible for the charm and fascination of his books. The feel and smell of the countryside, also a sense of movement, find their way into these light-hearted wanderings, and, combined with humour, acute observation, sympathy and an engaging curiosity, have justly gained for them a wide and increasing popularity. Contents Include: I Go in Search of Scotland - I Explore Edinburgh - I See the Castle of Roslin - Tells how I go on Through Rain to Lochleven - In Which I Climb into the Highlands - I Describe a Mystery of Aberdeen - Describes a Sincere Scottish Breakfast - In Which I Work East to West - I Go by Sea to Sky - How I Break the Sabbath - I Sail up the Clyde into Glasgow - In Which I Encounter Men Who Melt Steel	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ImM_PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=ImM_PgAACAAJ&dq=In+search+of+Scotland&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=ImM_PgAACAAJ&dq=In+search+of+Scotland&hl=&source=gbs_api	Hesperides Press	2006-07-01	{Travel}	2	User reviews of H.V.

488	Understanding Learning: The How, the Why, the What	Educational practice does not, for the most part, rely on research findings. Instead, there’s a preference for relying on our intuitions about what’s best for learning. But relying on intuition may be a bad idea for teachers and learners alike. This accessible guide helps teachers to integrate effective, research-backed strategies for learning into their classroom practice. The book explores exactly what constitutes good evidence for effective learning and teaching strategies, how to make evidence-based judgments instead of relying on intuition, and how to apply findings from cognitive psychology directly to the classroom.

619	Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, And The New Biology Of Mind	Brought together for the first time in a single volume, these eight important and fascinating essays by Nobel Prize-winning psychiatrist Eric Kandel provide a breakthrough perspective on how biology has influenced modern psychiatric thought. Complete with commentaries by experts in the field, Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and the New Biology of Mind reflects the author's evolving view of how biology has revolutionized psychiatry and psychology and how potentially could alter modern psychoanalytic thought. The author's unique perspective on both psychoanalysis and biological research has led to breakthroughs in our thinking about neurobiology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis -- all driven by the central idea that a fuller understanding of the biological processes of learning and memory can illuminate our understanding of behavior and its disorders. These wonderful essays cover the mechanisms of psychotherapy and medications, showing that both work at the same level of neural circuits and synapses, and the implications of neurobiological research for psychotherapy; the ability to detect functional changes in the brain after psychotherapy, which enables us, for the first time, to objectively evaluate the effects of psychotherapy on individual patients; the need for animal models of mental disorders; for example, learned fear, to show how molecules and cellular mechanisms for learning and memory can be combined in various ways to produce a range of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors; the unification of behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology into the new science of the mind, charted in two seminal reports on neurobiology and molecular biology given in 1983 and 2000; the critical role of synapses and synaptic strength in both short- and long-term learning; the biological and social implications of the mapping of the human genome for medicine in general and for psychiatry and mental health in particular; The author concludes by calling for a revolution in psychiatry, one that can use the power of biology and cognitive psychology to treat the many mentally ill persons who do not benefit from drug therapy. Fascinating reading for psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, social workers, residents in psychiatry, and trainees in psychoanalysis, Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and the New Biology of Mind records with elegant precision the monumental changes taking place in psychiatric thinking. It is an invaluable reference work and a treasured resource for thinking about the future.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KCkkoXVyKQcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=KCkkoXVyKQcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Psychiatry,+Psychoanalysis,+And+The+New+Biology+Of+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KCkkoXVyKQcC&source=gbs_api	American Psychiatric Pub	2008-05-20	{Medical}	3	"Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and the New Biology of Mind" by Nobel Prize-winning Eric Kandel is a collection of essays exploring the integration of biology with psychiatric thought.

512	'Pataphysics: The Poetics of an Imaginary Science (Avant-Garde & Modernism Studies)	'Pataphysics, the pseudoscience imagined by Alfred Jarry, has so far, because of its academic frivolity and hermetic perversity, attracted very little scholarly or critical inquiry, and yet it has inspired a century of experimentation. Tracing the place of 'pataphysics in the relationship between science and poetry, Christian Bök shows it is fundamental to the nature of the postmodern, and considers the work of Alfred Jarry and its influence on others. A long overdue critical look at a significant strain of the twentieth-century avant-garde, 'Pataphysics: The Poetics of Imaginary Science raises important historical, cultural, and theoretical issues germane to the production and reception of poetry, the ways we think about, write, and read it, and the sorts of claims it makes upon our understanding.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dzd7LyYblf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dzd7LyYblf8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%27Pataphysics:+The+Poetics+of+an+Imaginary+Science+(Avant-Garde&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dzd7LyYblf8C&dq=%27Pataphysics:+The+Poetics+of+an+Imaginary+Science+(Avant-Garde&hl=&source=gbs_api	Northwestern University Press	2002-01-01	{"Literary Criticism"}	2	The review criticizes Christian Bok's book, "'Pataphysics: the poetics of an imaginary science," for its misunderstanding and misrepresentation of 'Pataphysics, labeling it as "an imaginary science" and disregarding its roots and key figures. The reviewer argues Bok distorts and oversimplifies 'Pataphysics, misclassifying and ignoring major contributors. Bok's focus on Italian Futurism, French Oulipism, and Canadian Jarryism is seen as narrow and fails to adequately acknowledge their 'Pataphysical influences. The prose is described as lacking humor and wit, and the reviewer recommends other sources for those genuinely interested in 'Pataphysics.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

514	An Introductory New Testament Greek Course	Many Christians have the desire to read the New Testament in its original language. Unfortunately, books that introduce the student to New Testament Greek either tend to be long-winded, or overly simplified, or both. In this book, legendary scholar of biblical Greek, the late Frank Gignac provides a straight-forward "just the facts" approach to the subject. In fifteen lessons, he presents the basics of the grammar and the vocabulary essential for reading the Gospels in the original language. All the reader need do is to supply the desire to learn. As Gignac writes, "good luck as you begin to learn another language! It may be sheer drudgery for a while, but the thrill will come when you begin to read the New Testament in the language in which it was written."	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tLg3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=tLg3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=An+Introductory+New+Testament+Greek+Course&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=tLg3CgAAQBAJ&dq=An+Introductory+New+Testament+Greek+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api	CUA Press	2015-07-17	{"Foreign Language Study"}	1	Francis Gignac's "Introductory New Testament Greek Course" is praised for its engaging introduction to Greek, especially for students interested in New Testament studies.

Additionally, it offers insights into the Greek language's Semitic background. However, criticisms include its outdated format and the insufficient breakdown of verb systems, making it difficult for absolute beginners.

518	The Illusion of Public Opinion: Fact and Artifact in American Public Opinion Polls	In a rigorous critique of public opinion polling in the U.S., George F. Bishop makes the case that a lot of what passes as "public opinion" in mass media today is an illusion, an artifact of measurement created by vague or misleading survey questions presented to respondents who typically construct their opinions on the spot. Using evidence from a wide variety of data sources, Bishop shows that widespread public ignorance and poorly informed opinions are the norm rather than definitive public opinion on key political, social, and cultural issues of the day. The Illusion of Public Opinion presents a number of cautionary tales about how American public opinion has supposedly changed since 9/11, amplified by additional examples on other occasions drawn from the American National Election Studies. Bishop's analysis of the pitfalls of asking survey questions and interpreting poll results leads the reader to a more skeptical appreciation of the art and science of public opinion polling as it is practiced today.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fpzrs-bSD3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=fpzrs-bSD3gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Illusion+of+Public+Opinion:+Fact+and+Artifact+in+American+Public+Opinion+Polls&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=fpzrs-bSD3gC&dq=The+Illusion+of+Public+Opinion:+Fact+and+Artifact+in+American+Public+Opinion+Polls&hl=&source=gbs_api	Rowman & Littlefield	2005-01-01	{"Political Science"}	1	Professor George Bishop's book is highly regarded for its comprehensive review of academic studies and professional practices in public opinion research. It serves as an invaluable literature review and provides a critical perspective that media, academics, and the public should consider seriously. Bishop highlights issues with modern polling techniques, particularly in commercial and political contexts, but does not dismiss the value of polls entirely. His writing is accessible, making the book valuable beyond public opinion experts. The critiques and suggested procedures offer significant learning opportunities for improving the understanding and use of polls.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

522	Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum (The American Empire Project)	From the author of Resource Wars, a landmark assessment of the critical role of petroleum in America's actions abroad In his pathbreaking Resource Wars, world security expert Michael T. Klare alerted us to the role of resources in conflicts in the post-Cold War world. Now, in Blood and Oil, he concentrates on a single precious commodity, petroleum, while issuing a warning to the United States-its most powerful, and most dependent, global consumer. Since September 11th and the commencement of the "war on terror," the world's attention has been focused on the relationship between U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and the oceans of crude oil that lie beneath the region's soil. Klare traces oil's impact on international affairs since World War II, revealing its influence on the Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Carter doctrines. He shows how America's own wells are drying up as our demand increases; by 2010, the United States will need to import 60 percent of its oil. And since most of this supply will have to come from chronically unstable, often violently anti-American zones-the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea, Latin America, and Africa-our dependency is bound to lead to recurrent military involvement. With clarity and urgency, Blood and Oil delineates the United States' predicament and cautions that it is time to change our energy policies, before we spend the next decades paying for oil with blood.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6uu8hHc8zI0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=6uu8hHc8zI0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Blood+and+Oil:+The+Dangers+and+Consequences+of+America%27s+Growing+Dependency+on+Imported+Petroleum+(The+American+Empire+Project)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6uu8hHc8zI0C&source=gbs_api	Metropolitan Books	2007-04-01	{"Political Science"}	2	Michael Klare's book delves into the intricate relationship between U.S. foreign policy and oil dependency. The book highlights how American military operations, historically tied to securing foreign oil supplies, exacerbate geopolitical tensions. Klare criticizes the focus on military means over energy conservation and sustainable practices, noting that U.S. reliance on unstable regions for oil threatens long-term global stability. He warns that competition with nations like China and Russia for dwindling oil reserves could escalate into conflicts. While the book is well-researched and insightful, some critics argue that Klare overlooks the domestic political influences on energy policy and fails to explore alternative energy solutions in depth. Despite its lengthiness, the book is praised for offering a compelling narrative on the urgent need for the U.S. to transition towards a sustainable energy future.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

534	Math-U-See Foundations of Mathematics: Teacher Manual	"If you're a parent who has decided to educate your children yourself, this book is the first you should buy."—?Washington Times The Well-Trained Mind will instruct you, step by step, on how to give your child an academically rigorous, comprehensive education from preschool through high school—one that will train him or her to read, to think, to ?understand?, to be well-rounded and curious about learning. Veteran home educators Jessie Wise and Susan Wise Bauer outline the classical pattern of education called the trivium, which organizes learning around the maturing capacity of the child's mind and comprises three stages: the elementary school "grammar stage," the middle school "logic stage," and the high school "rhetoric stage." Using this theory as your model, you'll be able to instruct your child in all levels of reading, writing, history, geography, mathematics, science, foreign languages, rhetoric, logic, art, and music, regardless of your own aptitude in those subjects. This newly revised edition contains completely updated ordering information for all curricula and books, new and expanded curricula recommendations, new material on using computers and distance-learning resources, answers to common questions about home education, information about educational support groups, and advice on practical matters such as working with your local school board, preparing a high school transcript, and applying to colleges.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kblgelIEWc0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=kblgelIEWc0C&pg=PA94&dq=Math-U-See+Foundations+of+Mathematics:+Teacher+Manual&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kblgelIEWc0C&source=gbs_api	W.

The program is likened to successful methodologies used in Asian education, emphasizing building on previously learned concepts. The reviewer appreciates its effectiveness and simplicity, indicating it's easy for children to grasp. However, a downside is that its adoption in public schools is hindered by the interests of large textbook publishers, which could lead to significant industry and budget changes, ultimately disadvantaging students and taxpayers who miss out on this method's benefits.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Despite its merits, reviewers commonly note the collection's brevity and the absence of some pivotal poems like "Mending Wall" and "Stopping By the Woods on a Snowy Evening." The book is praised for being an affordable introduction to Frost's work, though avid fans may prefer a more comprehensive collection. Positively, it captures Frost's timeless New England themes; negatively, some criticize the quality of the physical book.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
537	Twins	Even twins are unique. Most people idealize twins, fantasizing a close, perpetually loving relationship. Yet Klein, herself an identical twin, demonstrates that twins have complicated and intense relationships that range from over-identification or excessive closeness to profound estrangement and conflict.

The book delves deeply into their personal and professional lives, leading to their eventual downfall, and offers insights into 1960s-70s New York City and its healthcare system. Reviewers praise its compelling storytelling and vivid descriptions, though some found it too explicit or intense. The novel inspired David Cronenberg's film "Dead Ringers," though both stand out in their own ways. Despite its brevity, readers find it a fascinating, if sometimes unsettling, read, worth exploring for fans of psychological horror.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

The book's positives include detailed historical context and its utility for genealogical research, as noted by those with ancestral ties to the region. However, significant critique arises from its unreflective and romanticized view of slavery. Negative feedback highlights Saxon's portrayal of black characters as childlike and deferential, perpetuating stereotypes. The work is compared unfavorably to other Southern authors for lacking critical engagement with racial issues, leaving some readers uncomfortable with its nostalgic tone towards a problematic past.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Many reviewers found it sufficient as a sole resource for passing the NCE and other counseling exams, appreciating the question-and-answer format with detailed explanations for correct and incorrect answers, aiding in deeper comprehension. The book also includes useful memory aids and mnemonics. However, some users criticized the insufficient coverage of career counseling and statistics, as well as its repetitive and occasionally condescending tone.

Some readers praise its engaging, entertaining, and thought-provoking exploration of writing style, valuing the insights from numerous author interviews and its challenge to traditional style guides like Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style." They appreciate Yagoda's accessible writing and the book’s cultural history of style. However, critics find the book disorganized and overly verbose, with Yagoda's criticism of Strunk & White seen as contrived.

His translations are highly recommended, especially when compared to Ben Belitt's criticized versions, which are seen as distorting Neruda's intention. O'Daly's work is considered a treasure for both new readers and those interested in the art of translation. The book includes 21 poems, reflecting themes of life, freedom, and acceptance, written during Neruda's illness. It's suggested to read the poems before O'Daly's introduction, which may offer too much initial interpretation.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
541	The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World	The internationally renowned theorist contends that the sun is setting on the American empire in this “lucid, informed, and insightful” account (The New York Times). The United States currently finds itself [a] superpower that lacks true power, a world leader nobody follows and few respect, and a nation drifting dangerously amidst a global chaos it cannot control. The United States in decline? Its admirers and detractors alike claim the opposite: America is now in a position of unprecedented global supremacy. But in fact, Immanuel Wallerstein argues, a more nuanced evaluation of recent history reveals that America has been fading as a global power since the end of the Vietnam War, and its response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 looks certain to hasten that decline. In this provocative collection, the visionary originator of world-systems analysis and the most innovative social scientist of his generation turns a practiced analytical eye to the turbulent beginnings of the twenty-first century. Touching on globalization, Islam, racism, democracy, intellectuals, and the state of the left wing, Wallerstein upends conventional wisdom to produce a clear-eyed—and troubling—assessment of the crumbling international order. “[Wallerstein’s thought] provides a new framework for the subject of European history . . . it is compelling, a new explanation, a new classification, indeed a revolutionary one, of received knowledge and current thought.” —Fernand Braudel	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HwcNKXjLWOEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=HwcNKXjLWOEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Decline+of+American+Power:+The+U.S.+in+a+Chaotic+World&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HwcNKXjLWOEC&source=gbs_api	New Press, The	2012-09-04	{"Political Science"}	1	Immanuel Wallerstein's book offers a compelling thesis on America's decline, traced back to the 1970s, through the lens of "world-systems" analysis. His insights are particularly strong in sections with clear language, detailing economic contrasts between Japan and the United States, as well as discussing capitalism's ongoing crisis. Positive feedback highlights the book's fresh perspective on global dynamics and America’s diminishing power due to its military-focused approach. However, criticism includes dense academic prose and a perceived focus on simplistic historical interpretations, such as overly stressing the impact of the Yalta Conference. The book's high price has also drawn consumer complaints, impacting its accessibility.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

The Courage to Be Disliked, already an enormous bestseller in Asia with more than 3.5 million copies sold, demonstrates how to unlock the power within yourself to be the person you truly want to be. Is happiness something you choose for yourself? The Courage to Be Disliked presents a simple and straightforward answer. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of nineteenth-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, this book follows an illuminating dialogue between a philosopher and a young man. Over the course of five conversations, the philosopher helps his student to understand how each of us is able to determine the direction of our own life, free from the shackles of past traumas and the expectations of others. Rich in wisdom, The Courage to Be Disliked will guide you through the concepts of self-forgiveness, self-care, and mind decluttering. It is a deeply liberating way of thinking, allowing you to develop the courage to change and ignore the limitations that you might be placing on yourself.

Many reviewers acknowledge the book's depth and intellectual challenge, noting its examination of faith, anxiety, and existential courage within the framework of Christian theology. Prospective readers highlight its profound impact on those grappling with existential crises and its insightful analysis of modern cultural despair. However, criticisms often include its dense language, abstract concepts, and lack of practical application. Some find Tillich’s ideas revolutionary, yet others perceive them as convoluted, incomplete, and possibly contradictory to traditional Christian beliefs.

550	Crete (Directions)	"His keen understanding of history and legend...illuminate[s] his visits." —Publishers Weekly "A vivid picture of the island." —Associated Press "It is hard to think of anywhere on earth where so many firsts and mosts are crammed into a space so small," Barry Unsworth writes of the isle of Crete. Birthplace of the Greek god Zeus, the Greek alphabet, and the first Greek laws, as well as the home of 15 mountain ranges and the longest gorge in Europe, this land is indisputably unique. And since ancient times, its inhabitants have maintained an astonishing tenacity and sense of national identity, even as they suffered conquest and occupation by Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Venetians, Ottoman Turks, and Germans. Throughout this evocative book, now in trade paper, Unsworth describes the incredible physical and cultural proportions of the island—in history, myth, and reality. Moving and artful, Crete gives readers a comprehensive picture and rich understanding of this complex—and indeed, almost magical—world of Mediterranean wonders. With the same keen eye and clear, eloquent prose that distinguishes his acclaimed historical novels, Barry Unsworth delivers his readers a two-fold traveler's reward, at once a wonderfully detailed panorama of Crete's many layers of history and an evocative portrait of an island almost literally larger than life.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xizc_SQTI_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=xizc_SQTI_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Crete+(Directions)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=xizc_SQTI_cC&dq=Crete+(Directions)&hl=&source=gbs_api	National Geographic Books	2011-06-15	{Travel}	1	The reviews praise Unsworth's book as an evocative and engaging travel guide to Crete, lauding its ability to vividly capture the island’s culture, scenery, and history through a first-person narrative. Readers appreciate Unsworth’s descriptive storytelling, which brings to life the flavors, smells, and sights of Crete in a way that surpasses traditional travel media. However, the book is noted to be non-comprehensive, offering more of an impressionistic account rather than a detailed history or exhaustive guide. While some may find it lacking in depth, fans of Unsworth and those seeking a reflective travel experience will find it rewarding.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

555	The Poetry of the Faerie Queene	The Faerie Queene was the first epic in English and one of the most influential poems in the language for later poets from Milton to Tennyson. Dedicating his work to Elizabeth I, Spenser brilliantly united medieval romance and renaissance epic to expound the glory of the Virgin Queen. The poem recounts the quests of knights including Sir Guyon, Knight of Constance, who resists temptation, and Artegall, Knight of Justice, whose story alludes to the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. Composed as an overt moral and political allegory, The Faerie Queene, with its dramatic episodes of chivalry, pageantry and courtly love, is also a supreme work of atmosphere, colour and sensuous description.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NOXy5pkw3sEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=NOXy5pkw3sEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Poetry+of+the+Faerie+Queene&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NOXy5pkw3sEC&source=gbs_api	Penguin UK	2003-11-27	{Poetry}	12	Paul Alpers' book on "The Faerie Queene" is highly recommended for students of the work, despite being somewhat dated.

The overall feedback is positive, with encouragement for more people to explore the book.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
556	Paris on the Seine	A vibrant, enchanting tour of the Seine from longtime New York Times foreign correspondent and best-selling author Elaine Sciolino. Elaine Sciolino came to Paris as a young foreign correspondent and was seduced by a river. In The Seine, she tells the story of that river from its source on a remote plateau of Burgundy to the wide estuary where its waters meet the sea, and the cities, tributaries, islands, ports, and bridges in between. Sciolino explores the Seine through its rich history and lively characters: a bargewoman, a riverbank bookseller, a houseboat dweller, a famous cinematographer known for capturing the river’s light. She discovers the story of Sequana—the Gallo-Roman healing goddess who gave the Seine its name—and follows the river through Paris, where it determined the city’s destiny and now snakes through all aspects of daily life. She patrols with river police, rows with a restorer of antique boats, sips champagne at a vineyard along the river, and even dares to go for a swim. She finds the Seine in art, literature, music, and movies from Renoir and Les Misérables to Puccini and La La Land. Along the way, she reveals how the river that created Paris has touched her own life. A powerful afterword tells the dramatic story of how water from the depths of the Seine saved Notre-Dame from destruction during the devastating fire in April 2019. A “storyteller at heart” (June Sawyers, Chicago Tribune) with a “sumptuous eye for detail” (Sinclair McKay, Daily Telegraph), Sciolino braids memoir, travelogue, and history through the Seine’s winding route. The Seine offers a love letter to Paris and the most romantic river in the world, and invites readers to explore its magic for themselves.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x_uKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=x_uKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Paris+on+the+Seine&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x_uKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	W.

676	Taino: Pre-Columbian Art & Culture from the Caribbean	Organized by El Museo del Barrio in New York to coincide with a major exhibition, this is the first comprehensive English-language publication on the fascinating legacy of Taiacute;no art and culture. Showcasing over one hundred rare and beautiful ceremonial and domestic artworks and individual masterpieces of this ancient culture -- produced in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Haiti, and the Bahamas between A.D. 1200 and 1500 --Taiacute;noincludes examples of finely detailed and polished sculptures carved in wood, precious ornaments of shell and bone, and ceramics decorated with animals, birds, and intricate geometric motifs. The contributors include ten of the foremost scholars of pre-Columbian culture and art, and an appendix features writings from Spanish explorers who had contact with the Taiacute;no. Of Arawak descent, the Taiacute;no -- whose ancestors migrated to the Caribbean from the Amazon Basin in South America during the sixth century -- were the first people encountered by Christopher Columbus. Although they ceased to exist as an autonomous society within sixty years of the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the Taiacute;no -- skilled agriculturists and navigators and accomplished weavers, potters, and carvers -- developed a complex political, religious, and social system, and made a substantial contribution to the biological, cultural, and linguistic makeup of large areas of the Caribbean. To this date, Caribbean communities in the Antilles and in New York and other large American cities exhibit the survival of Taiacute;no practices in their worldviews, religious beliefs, language, music, and food.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BEh7AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=BEh7AAAAMAAJ&q=Taino:+Pre-Columbian+Art&dq=Taino:+Pre-Columbian+Art&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=BEh7AAAAMAAJ&dq=Taino:+Pre-Columbian+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api	NaN	1997-01-01	{Art}	1	"Taíno: Pre-Columbian Art and Culture from the Caribbean" is praised as the most comprehensive resource on Taíno art and crafts. It presents a global collection representing the Greater Antilles, accompanied by essays from prominent Caribbean researchers. Ricardo E. Alegría's essay is highlighted for its excellent summary of Taíno life. The book is recommended for those interested in Caribbean and pre-Columbian culture for its scholarly essays and beautiful images; however, some content may be outdated for specialists. While recognized as the best available resource on Taíno culture, some feel the private ownership of artifacts limits public access.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
557	Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier: The Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (Perspectives on South Texas, sponsored by Texas A&M; University-Kingsville)	The story behind the birds everyone wants to see Halfway between Dallas and Mexico City, along the last few hundred miles of the Rio Grande, lies a subtropical outpost where people come from all over the world to see birds. Located between the temperate north and the tropic south, with desert to the west and ocean to the east, the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas provides habitat for a variety of birds seen nowhere else in the United States. If you want to see a Hooked-billed Kite, Muscovy Duck, or Altamira Oriole, this is the place. Drawing on years of personal observation and study, Timothy Brush has written a classic work of natural history about the little-known breeding bird communities of the Valley and the diversity of nesting strategies and behaviors that can be seen. Brush estimates that there are more than 150 current breeding species in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. In Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier, he describes the habits, distribution, changes in occurrence, and general outlook of these as well as former breeders, concentrating on Valley specialties and other birds of particular interest in the Valley. The species are all dependent upon appropriate habitat, from riparian forest to mesquite savannah, and Brush describes the history of these habitats and the special features that keep the birds coming. He also discusses conservation and the need for both large-scale land acquisitions by public and private groups and small-scale restoration through urban parks and individual landscaping. Art by Gerald Sneed and color photographs by several of Texas’ top nature photographers show off some of the Valley’s famous birds. Historical maps of vegetation and geology help us gain a better perspective on the changes that have taken place along the Rio Grande and on the breeding bird communities of the U.S.–Mexico frontier.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cMLC5c2Xr2YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMLC5c2Xr2YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nesting+Birds+of+a+Tropical+Frontier:+The+Lower+Rio+Grande+Valley+of+Texas+(Perspectives+on+South+Texas,+sponsored+by+Texas+A&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMLC5c2Xr2YC&dq=Nesting+Birds+of+a+Tropical+Frontier:+The+Lower+Rio+Grande+Valley+of+Texas+(Perspectives+on+South+Texas,+sponsored+by+Texas+A&hl=&source=gbs_api	Texas A&M University Press	2005-10-06	{Nature}	1	The reviews praise Timothy Brush's "Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier" for its thorough and encyclopedic examination of the bird species in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas. It highlights the region's rich bird diversity, including rare Mexican species. Brush's book is valued for its scientific depth, yet remains engaging due to personal asides from the author. While considered an authoritative resource for southern Texas birdlife, the feedback notes that the photos and artwork are unremarkable.

575	Getting It Published: A Guide for Scholars and Anyone Else Serious about Serious Books (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)	For more than a decade, writers have turned to William Germano for his insider’s take on navigating the world of scholarly publishing. A professor, author, and thirty-year veteran of the book industry, Germano knows what editors want and what writers need to know to get their work published. Today there are more ways to publish than ever, and more challenges to traditional publishing. This ever-evolving landscape brings more confusion for authors trying to understand their options. The third edition of Getting It Published offers the clear, practicable guidance on choosing the best path to publication that has made it a trusted resource, now updated to include discussions of current best practices for submitting a proposal, of the advantages and drawbacks of digital publishing, and tips for authors publishing textbooks and in open-access environments. Germano argues that it’s not enough for authors to write well—they also need to write with an audience in mind. He provides valuable guidance on developing a compelling book proposal, finding the right publisher, evaluating a contract, negotiating the production process, and, finally, emerging as a published author. “This endlessly useful and expansive guide is every academic’s pocket Wikipedia: a timely, relevant, and ready resource on scholarly publishing, from the traditional monograph to the digital e-book.

He argues that the golden era of criticism began in the late 18th century with figures like Addison and Steele, who fostered rational discourse in the public sphere. In contrast, by the contemporary period, criticism had become akin to public relations for publishers and an insular academic activity.

582	Machine Vision	In the last 40 years, machine vision has evolved into a mature field embracing a wide range of applications including surveillance, automated inspection, robot assembly, vehicle guidance, traffic monitoring and control, signature verification, biometric measurement, and analysis of remotely sensed images. While researchers and industry specialists continue to document their work in this area, it has become increasingly difficult for professionals and graduate students to understand the essential theory and practicalities well enough to design their own algorithms and systems. This book directly addresses this need. As in earlier editions, E.R.

583	Terror and Liberalism	A philosophical examination of the War on Terror draws a parallel between Islamic extremism and political movements throughout history, calling for a "new radicalism" to achieve a free world.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HANP-1hOO6YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=HANP-1hOO6YC&q=Terror+and+Liberalism&dq=Terror+and+Liberalism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=HANP-1hOO6YC&dq=Terror+and+Liberalism&hl=&source=gbs_api	W W Norton & Company Incorporated	2003-01-01	{"Political Science"}	2	"Terror and Liberalism" by Paul Berman offers an analysis of modern Islamic extremism as a continuation of the totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century, such as fascism and communism. Berman argues that these movements share a common rejection of liberal values, advocating for death-centric philosophies. He critically assesses the failure of both the left and right to recognize and combat this threat effectively, calling for a "war of ideas." While praised for its thought-provoking insights and engaging prose, the book draws criticism for its lack of detailed references, in-depth analysis, and reliance on speculative claims. Some reviewers find Berman's attempt to align the left with the war on terror commendable but feel that his solutions and historical depth are lacking. Despite this, the work is recommended for its challenging perspective on the ideological struggle against radical Islamism.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08
584	THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY, PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE STATE.	The most influential theory of the origins of women's oppression in the modern era, in a beautiful new edition In this provocative and now-classic work, Frederick Engels explores the interrelated development of the family and the state from ancient society to the Victorian era. Drawing on new anthropological theories of his time, Engels argued that matriarchal communal societies had been overthrown by class society and its emphasis on private, not communal, property and monogamous, rather than polygamous, sexual organization. This historical development, Engels argued, constituted "the world-historic defeat of the female sex." A masterclass in the application of materialist thought to history and anthropology, and touching on love, monogamy, property, and the development of the human, this landmark work is still foundational in Marxist and socialist feminist theory.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSk5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=MSk5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+ORIGIN+OF+THE+FAMILY,+PRIVATE+PROPERTY+AND+THE+STATE.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=MSk5EAAAQBAJ&dq=THE+ORIGIN+OF+THE+FAMILY,+PRIVATE+PROPERTY+AND+THE+STATE.&hl=&source=gbs_api	Verso Books	2021-08-17	{"Political Science"}	1	The reviews of Engels' book highlight its in-depth exploration of the evolution of human society, connecting the agricultural revolution to the emergence of class structures and patriarchy. Engels discusses the impact of wealth accumulation on family structures and the transition from communal to private property, using examples like the Iroquois Nation and ancient democracies. Positive feedback acknowledges the book's relevance to socialist and communist thought, particularly its insights on capitalism and gender oppression. However, criticisms include outdated anthropological assumptions, incomplete text due to printing errors, and Marx and Engels' inaccuracies regarding human nature. Overall, despite flaws, the book is valued for its historical and theoretical contributions.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

587	From Dissertation to Book (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)	When a dissertation crosses my desk, I usually want to grab it by its metaphorical lapels and give it a good shake. “You know something!” I would say if it could hear me. “Now tell it to us in language we can understand!” Since its publication in 2005, From Dissertation to Book has helped thousands of young academic authors get their books beyond the thesis committee and into the hands of interested publishers and general readers. Now revised and updated to reflect the evolution of scholarly publishing, this edition includes a new chapter arguing that the future of academic writing is in the hands of young scholars who must create work that meets the broader expectations of readers rather than the narrow requirements of academic committees. At the heart of From Dissertation to Book is the idea that revising the dissertation is fundamentally a process of shifting its focus from the concerns of a narrow audience—a committee or advisors—to those of a broader scholarly audience that wants writing to be both informative and engaging. William Germano offers clear guidance on how to do this, with advice on such topics as rethinking the table of contents, taming runaway footnotes, shaping chapter length, and confronting the limitations of jargon, alongside helpful timetables for light or heavy revision. Germano draws on his years of experience in both academia and publishing to show writers how to turn a dissertation into a book that an audience will actually enjoy, whether reading on a page or a screen. Germano also acknowledges that not all dissertations can or even should become books and explores other, often overlooked, options, such as turning them into journal articles or chapters in an edited work. With clear directions, engaging examples, and an eye for the idiosyncrasies of academic writing, From Dissertation to Book reveals to recent PhDs the secrets of careful and thoughtful revision—a skill that will be truly invaluable as they add “author” to their curriculum vitae.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ro7zAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ro7zAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=From+Dissertation+to+Book+(Chicago+Guides+to+Writing,+Editing,+and+Publishing)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ro7zAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	University of Chicago Press	2014-02-27	{Reference}	2	The reviews for Germano's book on converting a dissertation into a book offer a mix of positive and negative feedback. Positively, many readers found it practical and helpful, particularly for new scholars who struggle with the transition from dissertation to book, appreciating Germano's realistic insights into academic publishing. His advice on writing style and structure, though perceived as wordy and repetitive, was deemed useful by some. Negatively, critics argued that the book's advice is often redundant or obvious, and limited in scope, primarily focusing on young academics aiming for traditional academic publishing. Some suggested alternative resources like Beth Luey's "Revising Your Dissertation."	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

594	Cuba Diaries	The face of modern-day Cuba is in many respects still frozen in the 1950s, with its classic American cars, horse-drawn carriages and colonial Spanish architecture. In a country where taxi drivers earn more than doctors, understanding Cuba is a compelling but never-ending task. In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Cuba was plunged into crisis. Having been subsidized by the Soviet Union to the tune of $3 million a day, the country's economy entered freefall. The ban on the US dollar was lifted, the floodgates of tourism opened and the salaries of Cubans in contact with foreigners went into orbit. Into Castro's fortress of dollar-fuelled hedonism and communist austerity came the American wife of a European energy consultant posted to Havana, and their two small children. Isadora Tattlin befriended Cubans from all walks of life, gave dozens of parties - even Fidel Castro came to dinner! - and kept a daily diary. The result is a remarkable testimony to a unique period in Cuba's history when el triunfo de la revolucion was beginning to clash with the powerful lure of multinational consumerism.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BoWGVwuh_NYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=BoWGVwuh_NYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cuba+Diaries&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BoWGVwuh_NYC&source=gbs_api	Random House	2012-04-24	{Travel}	7	The reviews highlight the book's fascinating details, though some readers are skeptical about the authenticity of certain stories, suspecting them to be urban myths.

597	Thumbs Up Australia: Hitching the Outback	On the Road meets Down Under in this really rough guide to the adventures of an enthusiastic hitchhiker and his reluctant girlfriend on their quest for the real Australia. Hitching lifts with the desert's dodgiest drivers and taking breaks in the roughest roadhouses, this is Tom Parry's witty, warts-and-all tale of hitchhiking 8,000 miles across - and around - the Australian outback with his thumb, his backpack and his French girlfriend, Katia. As the couple hitch their way around the near empty highways, they encounter as wide a cross-section of Aussie society as you could ever hope to meet. In cattle stations, Aboriginal communities, remote waterholes, caravan parks, hippy communes and roadhouses, they see a country that remains as extraordinary today as it was for the first nineteenth century settlers.

While it features poetic writing and self-revelation, the natural history elements serve more as metaphors. Positive feedback highlights its emotional depth and resonance for those on personal quests for meaning. However, criticism arises from expectations of a memoir, noting the author's limited knowledge of Hawaii due to leaving at a young age. The lack of character development and real connections to his past detracts from the memoir's impact, making the spiritual reflections feel somewhat hollow and contrived.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

616	Done in a Day: 100 Years of Great Writing from the Chicago Daily News	The story of the rise and fall of those comic books has never been fully told -- until The Ten-Cent Plague. David Hajdu's remarkable new book vividly opens up the lost world of comic books, its creativity, irreverence, and suspicion of authority. In the years between World War II and the emergence of television as a mass medium, American popular culture as we know it was first created—in the pulpy, boldly illustrated pages of comic books. No sooner had this new culture emerged than it was beaten down by church groups, community bluestockings, and a McCarthyish Congress—only to resurface with a crooked smile on its face in Mad magazine. When we picture the 1950s, we hear the sound of early rock and roll. The Ten-Cent Plague shows how -- years before music -- comics brought on a clash between children and their parents, between prewar and postwar standards. Created by outsiders from the tenements, garish, shameless, and often shocking, comics spoke to young people and provided the guardians of mainstream culture with a big target. Parents, teachers, and complicit kids burned comics in public bonfires. Cities passed laws to outlaw comics. Congress took action with televised hearings that nearly destroyed the careers of hundreds of artists and writers. The Ten-Cent Plague radically revises common notions of popular culture, the generation gap, and the divide between "high" and "low" art. As he did with the lives of Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington (in Lush Life) and Bob Dylan and his circle (in Positively 4th Street), Hajdu brings a place, a time, and a milieu unforgettably back to life.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U7B6EPG7vG8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=U7B6EPG7vG8C&pg=PA359&dq=Done+in+a+Day:+100+Years+of+Great+Writing+from+the+Chicago+Daily+News&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U7B6EPG7vG8C&source=gbs_api	Farrar, Straus and Giroux	2008-03-18	{"Comics & Graphic Novels"}	13	This book is highly recommended for journalism enthusiasts, praised for its insightful take on the newspaper industry.

617	The Double-Cross System	J.C. Masterman was chairman of the Double-Cross Committee at the height of World War Two. This is his account of the double agents, deception and counter-espionage which were key to the victory of D-Day. Written as an official report for MI5 in 1945, originally published with the permission of the British Government over twenty years later, The Double-Cross System details the Allied handling of enemy agents and the British infiltration of Nazi spy-rings.

621	Men in the Off Hours	Following her widely acclaimed Autobiography of Red ('a spellbinding achievement' - Susan Sontag): a new collection of poetry and prose that displays Anne Carson's intoxicating mixture of opposites - the classic and the modern, cinema and print, narrative and verse. In Men in the Off Hours, Carson re-invents figures as diverse as Oedipus, Emily Dickinson and Audubon. She views the writings of Sappho, St Augustine and Catullus through a modern lens. She sets up startling juxtapositions (Lazarus among video paraphernalia; Virginia Woolf and Thucydides discussing war). And, in a final prose poem, she meditates on the recent death of her mother. With its quiet, acute spirituality, its fearless wit and sensuality, and its joyful understanding that 'the fact of the matter for humans is imperfection', Men in the Off Hours is profound, provocative and unforgettable.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zKO1wAdOpu4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=zKO1wAdOpu4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Men+in+the+Off+Hours&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zKO1wAdOpu4C&source=gbs_api	Random House	2011-10-31	{"Literary Criticism"}	1	Anne Carson's collection "Men in the Off Hours" is a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and is praised for its intellectual and experimental approach to poetry.

This new and updated edition encompasses his writing through his death in 2007. Marc Leeds, co-founder and founding president of the Kurt Vonnegut Society and a longtime personal friend of the author’s, has devoted more than twenty-five years of his life to cataloging the Vonnegut cosmos—from the birthplace of Kilgore Trout (Vonnegut’s sci-fi writing alter ego) to the municipal landmarks of Midland City (the midwestern metropolis that is the setting for Vonnegut’s 1973 masterpiece Breakfast of Champions). The Vonnegut Encyclopedia identifies every major and minor Vonnegut character from Celia Aamons to Zog, as well as recurring images and relevant themes from all of Vonnegut’s works, including lesser-known gems like his revisionist libretto for Stravinsky’s opera L’Histoire du soldat and his 1980 children’s book Sun Moon Star. Leeds provides expert notes explaining the significance of many items, but relies primarily on extended quotations from Vonnegut himself. A work of impressive scholarship in an eminently browsable package, this encyclopedia reveals countless connections readers may never have thought of on their own. A rarity among authors of serious fiction, Kurt Vonnegut has always inspired something like obsession in his most dedicated fans. The Vonnegut Encyclopedia is an invaluable resource for readers wishing to revisit his fictional universe—and those about to explore it for the first time.

The book is considered poorly structured, factual errors abound, and Yudkoff's narrative approach, which includes fictionalized internal monologues, is seen as disrespectful to both Kelly’s life and the biography genre. Positive comments note that the beginning sections are engaging and informative about Kelly’s early life, but critics unanimously agree that the latter half of Kelly's life is inadequately covered.

637	Out of Control (Defender (Americana))	The American cinema of terrorism, although coming to prominence primarily in the 1970s amidst high-profile Palestinian terrorist activity, actually dates back to the beginnings of the Cold War. But this early terrorist cinema was centered largely around the Bomb—who had it, who would use it, when—and differs greatly from the terrorist cinema that would follow. Changing world events soon broadened the cinema of terrorism to address emerging international conflicts, including Black September, pre–9/11 Middle Eastern conflicts, and the post–9/11 “War on Terror.” This analytical filmography of American terrorist films establishes terrorist cinema as a unique subgenre with distinct thematic narrative and stylistic trends. It covers all major American films dealing with terrorism, from Otto Preminger’s Exodus (1960) to Ridley Scott’s Body of Lies (2008).	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nV4BvL8AqEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=nV4BvL8AqEwC&pg=PA216&dq=Out+of+Control+(Defender+(Americana))&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nV4BvL8AqEwC&source=gbs_api	McFarland	2009-10-21	{"Performing Arts"}	1	Ahern's series is praised for its engaging characters, reminiscent of those in his Survivor Series.

638	The Hybrid Muse: Postcolonial Poetry in English	Postcolonial novelists such as Salman Rushdie and V.S.

640	The Bible the Old Testament According to Spike Milligan	The Bible According to Spike Milligan is an irreverent but very funny spoof of The Old Testament in which, in his own inimitable fashion, Spike Milligan gives his version of the best known biblical stories.In the Bible, according to Spike Milligan: "In the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and darkness was upon the face of the deep; this was due to a malfunction at Lots Road Power Station...And God said 'Let there be light'."'Desperately funny, vivid, vulgar' Sunday Times 'Milligan is the Great God to all of us' John Cleese 'The Godfather of Alternative Comedy' Eddie Izzard 'That absolutely glorious way of looking at things differently.

It's useful for both novices and seasoned enthusiasts and especially helpful for exploring out-of-print albums, unlike the Penguin Guide. However, it lacks personnel detail and consistent reviewing seen in Penguin, with some albums reviewed briefly or not at all. Mistakes and small type in the new edition are noted downsides.

Users praise its systematic approach and comprehensive coverage of the boat-building process, making it valuable for both amateur and professional builders. However, some readers find the content outdated and not ideal for modernizing older boats, while others cite issues with British English terms that may be unfamiliar to North American readers.

648	Sound Wormy: Memoir of Andrew Gennett, Lumberman	Set in what remains some of the wildest country in the United States, Sound Wormy recalls a time when regulations were few and resources were abundant for the southern lumber industry. In 1901 Andrew Gennett put all of his money into a tract of timber along the Chattooga River watershed, which traverses parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. By the time he wrote his memoir almost forty years later, Gennett had outwitted and outworked countless competitors in the southern mountains to make his mark as one of the region's most seasoned, innovative, and successful lumbermen. His recollections of a rough-and-ready outdoors life are filled with details of logging, from the first "cruise" of a timber stand to the moment when the last board lies "on sticks" in the mill yard. He tells how massive poplars, oaks, and other hardwoods had to be felled and trimmed by hand, dragged down mountain slopes by draft animals, floated downstream or carried by rail to the mill, and then sawn, graded, and stacked for drying. He tells of buying timber rights in a land market filled with "sharp" operators, where titles and surveys were often contested and kinship and custom were on an equal footing with the law. Gennett saw more than potential "boardfeet" when he looked at a tree. He recalls, for instance, his efforts to convince the U.S. Forest Service to purchase undisturbed areas of wilderness at a time when its mandate was to condemn and buy up farmed-out and clear-cut land. One such sale initiated by Gennett would become the Joyce Kilmer Wilderness in North Carolina. Filled with logging lore and portraits of the southern mountains and their people, Sound Wormy adds an absorbing new chapter to the region's natural and environmental history.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5arHjMc2-xcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=5arHjMc2-xcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sound+Wormy:+Memoir+of+Andrew+Gennett,+Lumberman&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=5arHjMc2-xcC&dq=Sound+Wormy:+Memoir+of+Andrew+Gennett,+Lumberman&hl=&source=gbs_api	University of Georgia Press	2010-07-01	{"Technology & Engineering"}	1	"Sound Wormy" is an engaging autobiography of Andrew Gennett, a pioneer lumberman in the Southern Appalachians. Based on Gennett’s personal papers and edited by Nicole Hayler, the book offers detailed insights into historical logging practices, the entrepreneurial spirit, and the challenges faced, such as difficult conditions and economic hardship. Positive feedback highlights the book’s detailed narrative, Gennett's hands-on approach, and the fascinating accounts of life in isolated areas. However, some readers noted the absence of maps detailing specific locations, which could make navigation through Gennett's journey a bit challenging. Overall, it's recommended for those interested in logging history and regional culture.	\N	2025-06-07 10:14:10.969701+08

Yes, you'll get all your burning and why-is-it-burning questions answered, but the advice is coming from a son-of-a-bitch with a breathtaking gift for the gratuitous insult. In these pages, you'll find medical answers to everything from how you can ejaculate farther to how you can take--ahem--more cargo on your loading dock. Alvear answers questions with the compassion of a caffeine addict out of coffee, lining up a panel of doctors and psychologists against the wall and beating the truth out of them. The result is a marriage of impeccably accurate information, politically incorrect opinion and withering sarcasm. Because the questions come from gay men all over the country, they're like a peephole into the anxieties, concerns and worries that gay men have about sex. Here's a sampling of what you'll learn: . . . Only 6% of the population need extra-large condoms. Get over it. . . . The average erect penis is 5. I" long and 4.8" around. Unless you're in a chat room. Then double it. . . . Kegel exercises will give you harder hard-ons and more powerful orgasms. But then, so will an 18-year-old. . . . 50% of men on anti-depressants experience sexual side effects. And no, having an affair is not considered a side effect you can blame on medicine. With buzz-saw wit, Men Are Pigs, But We Love Bacon will leave you laughing, howling, and knowing everything you need to know about sex.	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zVVwg_xkmZAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=zVVwg_xkmZAC&dq=Men+Are+Pigs,+But+We+Love+Bacon:+Not-So-Straight+Answers+from+America%27s+Most+Outrageous+Gay+Sex+Columnist&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=zVVwg_xkmZAC&dq=Men+Are+Pigs,+But+We+Love+Bacon:+Not-So-Straight+Answers+from+America%27s+Most+Outrageous+Gay+Sex+Columnist&hl=&source=gbs_api	Kensington Books	2014-11-06	{Self-Help}	2	"Men Are Pigs, But We Love Bacon" by Alvear, a collection of sex advice from his "Hey, Woody" column, is characterized by its blunt and humorous exploration of male sexuality, particularly from a gay man's perspective.

The originals are in the Riccar Art Museum in Tokyo, the world's largest and most celebrated collection of such prints.

For experts, Rolfsen explains advanced topics, such as the connections between knot theory and surgery and how they are useful to understanding three-manifolds. Besides providing a guide to understanding knot theory, the book offers 'practical' training. After reading it, you will be able to do many things: compute presentations of knot groups, Alexander polynomials, and other invariants; perform surgery on three-manifolds; and visualize knots and their complements.It is characterized by its hands-on approach and emphasis on a visual, geometric understanding. Rolfsen offers invaluable insight and strikes a perfect balance between giving technical details and offering informal explanations. The illustrations are superb, and a wealth of examples are included. Now back in print by the AMS, the book is still a standard reference in knot theory. It is written in a remarkable style that makes it useful for both beginners and researchers. Particularly noteworthy is the table of knots and links at the end. This volume is an excellent introduction to the topic and is suitable as a textbook for a course in knot theory or 3-manifolds. Other key books of interest on this topic available from the AMS are ""The Shoelace Book: A Mathematical Guide to the Best (and Worst) Ways to Lace your Shoes"" and ""The Knot Book"".	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=naYJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api	http://books.google.nl/books?id=naYJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Knots&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api	https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=naYJBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api	American Mathematical Soc.	2003-01-01	{Mathematics}	1	The book receives mixed reviews from users with a generally positive consensus but some notable criticisms.

As the author ofSEX, MURDER AND PARAPHILIA (Chronicles of Sodom)andA Woman of Middle Age- An erotic story of self-discovery and romanceI think this Well written, and entertaining But . . .Have you ever heard a good looking woman toot in public, a real stinky, sour smelling toot? This is similar. Enough to be noticed by the audience, yet with nothing real to offer but an offended grin on your face. If there were a zero star rating in terms of contribution to society besides being a conversation piece about the worst relationship advice, I'd give this one a Naught, zero, zilch, nix.I'll tell you what is wrong with this book. This is a manual to becoming a bitter and angry spinster. Take for instance, when she says;"What would happen if you let him know from day one that you are willing to bend over backward? He'd think you're desperate, and he'd want to see just how far you'd be willing to bend. It is human nature...He'd immediately start to test the waters. The more malleable you'd become, the more he'd expect you to bend. He'llInstantly perceive you as a Duracell battery,"This is her idea of a relationship . . . Hold . . . Hold . . . Not yet, he has not proven himself. Hold . . . Okay now give him half a cookie and then, Hold. . . Hold . . . Nope I have to yank that chain, not taut enough. Hold . . . Hold . . . half a cookie . . . Hold . . . .Guess what? Real relationships are based on people who come together swinging and hold nothing back. Show me who you are from the word go, honesty upfront gets you the man/woman. Show me that you are capable and willing to go all the way for me because I will show you right off the bat that I will take a bullet for you and bend backward, sideways and walk 500 miles for you and I will show you this the minute I lay eyes on you and want you to be my mate. If you hold that back from the word go, I will move on to the girl that will show me her devotion and dedication off the bat.Her advice is so sick that it sounds like it came from a sociopath, from someone with deep trust issues that has been hurt in so many awful untrustworthy ways, that she had to write a book about it. This could be fact only if you were dating a person with the mentality of an immature egoistical narcissistic teenager. Adults, responsible adults, do not push the limits. We compensate, we accommodate, and we sacrifice for our loved ones. When in a loving caring relationship, we are willing to take bullets for one another. If you can't demonstrate your ability to bend backward for your life-mate from day one, you WILL be alone for perpetuity--your perpetuity.Another one of my peeve fallacies in this book;"The nice girl sits in a chair after a week of knowing the guy, bored out of her mind as he does something that interests him. He may be watching sports on TV,Cleaning his fishing gear, strumming his guitar, or working on his car. She is miserable but doesn't say a peep. Instead, she tries to make the best of it and twiddles her thumbs politely, just so she can be in his company."Does anyone else see something wrong with the above? It really sounds like what happened to her after a week. After a week in a relationship! Maybe he was staying away waiting for you to leave after finding out how much of a dependent, needing and miserable bitch you were.I know, life together is supposed to be an eternal honeymoon, but if what he does on a day to day basis is not her ... think about it. He is doing what entertains him and it's not her he is doing. There is a time for you and a time for me and if your idea of a relationship is you at all times, you need to be in a relationship with yourself. And if my me time seems to go on forever, then maybe we are not compatible. Get it? Or get a life!Maybe you want him to stop what brings him joy (outside of you) and become bored (out of his mind) and by your side. You are waiting around for him to entertain you. Why don't you be independent? Be a person of your own for a change. Seriously, if you think what your better half is doing for leisure and pass time is not good, then you are with the wrong better half. Go find someone compatible.Women, take this advice and you are guaranteed to be a BITCH and a single BITCH at that. If you need someone who will pull you off that chair and whisk you to an imaginary Venice, then feed you something on a bed of roses for life, then read a Harlequin Novel, don't read this junk.What she said in this table, tickled my bone, "I AM NOT ENOUGH." VS. "I'M ENOUGH. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT." If you have to ask yourself these questions, then you are not ready to be in a relationship, PERIOD! This is the simple MATHEMATICS OF A RELATIONSHIP It takes two to be in a relationship. 1 + 1 = 2. So, 1+ 0.5 &#8800; 2. Each partner should have come into a relationship with a full glass. Else, the relationship will not work. 100% of you must complete 100% of him. Thinking in terms of being enough means you need some work on yourself before you partner with someone. Each partner only has 1 glass, and not 1.5 glasses. What this woman wants is someone to walk into a relationship with 1.5 glasses. This is not biologically possible unless you are from Krypton.Wait a minute, she says in this manual from bitch land that, if your man calls you, you need to get back to him when you are free. Call him back When you are free! She must be dealing with some real jerks in life. Because in my world, when I call her or she calls me, you better trust me, I'm picking up that phone unless I am dead! And if you feel your better half is calling you for no good reason that you need to get back to them when you darn please, then you need to be with someone else. Take this advice and your relationship will be as cacophonous as a hen yard.There is a reason men do not like bitches and women do not like jerks. Do not change who you are. It will not work! Books like this will chase that one man (woman) who might have been the one. It will chase him /her to the hills screaming BLOODY MARY!If there is compatibility and communication in a relationship, you do not have to worry about this junk and unfounded psychology. A little knowledge is dangerous and the ability to share it with the public at large is like a fart in a crowded room that is what this book is.Besides all its fallacies, it is an engaging piece of literature but nothing else.Imagine if we all behaved this way in our relationship? It would be a tug of war!

I have been waiting for this book to arrive for years and, finally, here it is!I was hooked by the opening chapter which tells the story of a young boy named Tiki Lofton who sneaks out of his bedroom window at night and over to a friend's apartment where, in 1960's South Central, with the help of a young Sylvester, he transforms himself into a "Disquotay." The Disquotays were a group of boys who liked to dress up as sophisticated ladies. And Sylvester, or Dooni as he was known then, was in charge of the wigs."The first Disquotay bash that Tiki went to was over on 120th and Athens, at Etta James's house, sometime around 1965. Etta, who would later be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (largely on the strength of her 1961 hit "At Last") and the Betty Ford Center (largely on the strength of her smack addiction), was already a recording star and a friend to many local Los Angeles drag queens . . . The house, with its swimming pool and fireplace, had stunned her. Women, drag queens, and guys, all sending joyful noises in Tiki's direction; the music had been jumping; Walter Jackson's version of "Lee Cross," Jr. Walker & the All Stars' "Shotgun," "Nowhere to Run" by Martha and the Vandellas, Fontella Bass singing "Rescue Me." Gay kids all perched on gigantic speakers, singing and carrying on . . . Tiki had said to herself. "This -- honey, where is this world?" Within months, she would be a full-fledged Disquotay, made-up, bewigged, bejeweled."Joshua Gamsom recreates this world vividly in that first chapter. Simultaneously, he introduces us to the members of Sylvester's family. His beautiful and beloved mother and grandmother. His twin sisters, Dette and Dean. The quotes are full of heart and expertly placed and the story unfolds like a fine silk fan. I can't help but think that Sylvester would be very pleased to read this biography.I had the honor of meeting with Sylvester to discuss a project a few years before his death. It was mid-afternoon and he was sewing sequins on something, which was his favorite pasttime. He was always sewing, a talent he picked up from the women who raised him. He walked over to the turntable and put on Patti LaBelle's "If Only You Knew" and said he was dedicating the song at his One-Night-Only concert the following night to his fans and supporters in San Francisco, the city in which he always felt most at home. That night, with Martha Wash at his side, they performed that song together, bouncing their voices off each other inside the Castro Theater. Those two powerful voices, the acoustics of the Castro Theater, and the magical spell he wove with Patti LaBelle's song was something to behold.That Sylvester could hold his own with the amazing Martha Wash is a testament to the power of his falsetto. He didn't have a thin, reedy falsetto. His was full-bodied, gravelly even, and very much in evidence on one of his biggest hits, "Do You Wanna Funk.""So when I tell you, that you're really something, baby, will you stay, or will you go away."Joshua Gamson captures the essence of Sylvester's personality, the diva fits as well as the immense kindness and sensitivity, and wraps it all together into an highly readable book that I wholeheartedly suggest you pick up. Although some have faulted him for not having an encyclopedic knowledge of music, Gamson lets experts like Joel Selvin provide insightful commentary.It is my hope that someone has optioned the book for a movie and we can expect to see this wild individual portrayed in all his glory.John Waters wraps up "The Fabulous Sylvester" pretty well in his cover blurb: "A well-written, touching, dignified biography of a gay black diva who never really fit into any minority but managed to achieve his dreams of stardom. Now that's what I call a man."Five Stars. Great Read.

His solution to the unpaid overtime is to lie to your employer and coworkers about how much you work at home, use oversized containers to take work home so it looks like more, schedule outside appointments late in the dy so you can just go home, etc. A lot of the book is aimed at helping people take better care of themselves and get their priorities in order, which I applaud. But that isn't what I was looking for in a time management book. I was looking for practical strategies for organizing my work and time, which it is thin on. It has some, and there are some very good ideas in there, but not really much more than a good magazine article.

As a stone cold adult beginner, I thought why not go for the book that sounded as if it was for a stone cold beginner - "Piano For Dummies"?Well, I certainly am a 'dummy' - shelling out over $20 for this discouraging pap is the dumbest thing I've done in years.I wrestled with it for quite a few weeks - trying to eke out hard information between the stupid humour and piano facts that I never asked for in the first place, dumb drawings and unhelpful layout. Then I called for a professional, feeling really discouraged. This book doesn't really even let you know at what point you might sit behind a piano and actually try playing? It's that bad.So I booked myself in with a professional piano teacher who within minutes made me realise it was the book and not me. I showed her the book which she referred to as "dreadful and patronising". She won't even allow me to have it back!She then handed me these two which are ideal for the older learner:- Piano For Adults (Bastien) ISBN 0-8497-7300-8- Accelerated Piano Adventures (Faber) ISBN 1-56939-132-7The former is my slight preference but both are leagues ahead of "Piano For Dummies". Sorry if that personally offends anyone, author included, but it is truly awful. I've now progressed more in a week than I did in two months with the Dummies book.Avoid.

The lone survivor is his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter.Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, rulers of Valley Dor, a white-skinned race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians of the outer world by disseminating the myth that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the beasts of Valley, the survivors enslaved by Therns.Carter and Tars Tarkas rescue Thuvia, a slave girl, and attempt to escape, capitalizing on the confusion caused by an attack by the Black Pirates of Barsoom upon the Therns. They are separated during the attack: Tars Tarkas and Thuvia hijack a Black Pirate flier, while Carter fights his way aboard another, killing all but one of the Pirates, and rescuing a captive Thern princess.Carter, talking with the captured Pirate Xodar, discovers that the Black Pirates, called the "First Born", also think of themselves as gods, and prey upon the Therns as the Therns prey upon others. He, also, discovers that the captive Thern is Phaidor, daughter of the "Holy Hekkador" (high priest) of the Therns. When their flier is recaptured by the First Born, they are taken to their land, built around the underground sea of Omean, below the lost sea of Korus and the Valley Dor. Both are located at the South Pole of Barsoom.Once there, Carter is taken before Issus, the goddess of Barsoom; an ancient, evil woman who has manipulated her own people and the rest of Barsoom into maintaining a hierarchy with the First Born on top. Issus dictates the policies of the Therns through secret communications with them. The Therns, thinking they are receiving divine communications, do not realize that they are duped by their enemies.Issus takes Phaidor into her service as a handmaiden for one Martian year. Carter is imprisoned, with Xodar as his slave as punishment for being defeated by Carter. Thereafter Carter treats him with honor, and thus gains in him a friend. In prison, they meet a young Red Martian captive from Carter's home country of Helium. Soon thereafter, Carter and the youth are taken to the monthly games of Issus.In the games, the handmaidens of a year before are sacrificed, and their bodies will be eaten by Issus and her nobles. Carter leads a revolt of the prisoners, killing many of the First Born. Carter and the youth almost kill Issus before the First Born suppress the revolt. Carter and the youth escape via underground tunnels, and give themselves up to guards unacquainted with the revolt to be returned to their prison island. Upon hearing the story of the revolt, Xodar rejects the notion of Issus' divinity.Carter, Xodar and the youth hijack a flier and escape. Soon after, Carter discovers that the youth is his son, Carthoris. The flier is damaged and must be abandoned in unknown territory. They encounter Thuvia, who describes the capture of Tars Tarkas by the green warriors of Warhoon (a clan rival to his own). Carter goes alone to rescue Tars Tarkas, but is discovered. After a chase, Thuvia is sent on alone mounted while the men attempt a last stand against the Warhoons. They are rescued by the Heliumetic navy; but do not find Thuvia.Commanding one of the warships is Carter's friend Kantos Kan; but the fleet is commanded by Zat Arras, a Jed (chieftain) of the hostile client state of Zodanga, and Carter is suspected of returning from Valley Dor, which is punishable by death. Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, the Jed of Hastor (the grandfather and father, respectively, of Dejah Thoris, and thus Carter's in-laws) are absent from Helium, having led fleets in search of Carter. Later, Carter discovers that Dejah Thoris is missing, believed to have taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find him.Upon returning to Helium, Carter is tried for heresy by the Zodangans; but the people of Helium do not tolerate this. To avoid civil war, Carter's judgment is deferred for a year. Sola, the daughter of Tars Tarkas, arrives, having escaped the First Born.Carter realizes that Dejah Thoris will be selected as a handmaiden of Issus, and thus will have only a year to live; wherefore he and his comrades go to rescue her. They uncover evidence that Thern spies are monitoring them, and Carter is kidnapped by the Zodangans. Carter refuses Zat Arras' offer of freedom in exchange for endorsing Zat Arras as Jeddak of Helium, and is imprisoned. After half a year in a dungeon, Carter wins his freedom through a ruse, and the mission to the land of the First Born is launched, with secretly raised troop levies, ships, and many troops lent by Tars Tarkas.Upon approaching the South Pole, a Thern fleet challenges Carter's fleet, and behind Carter's fleet arrive another fleet led Zat Arras. Finally, a fleet of First Born arrives, leaving the rescue mission for Dejah Thoris in jeopardy. Carter encourages the Therns and First Born to fight one another, and the Heliumetic crews of the Zodangan fleet mutiny in support of Carter. Carter then takes his remaining fleet with Tharkian troops to invade the underground sea of Omean.The combined Heliumites and Tharks defeat the First Born, and Issus herself is killed; but Dejah Thoris, Thuvia, and Phaidor, each of whom loves John Carter, are imprisoned in a room of the Temple of the Sun, of whose rooms each opens only once per yearThe Gods of Mars was serialized in five parts in All-Story magazine, the first part published in January 1913 and the final part published in May 1913. Burroughs was paid $750 for the novelThe next book in this series is .I highly recommend this book and this series to 12- 18 year olds who enjoy swashbuckling adventures and tales of derring-do.Gunner March, 2012

The spelling is inconsistent and doesn't provide help with pronunciation, definitions are often incomplete or inaccurate, no information is provided on ablaut and other features of the words, example sentences and collocations are scarce and their translations inaccurate.Buechel's dictionary is a typical example of lexicographical work done by the early missionaries among native people; it is a mixture of very careful and very careless work. There is much valuable data in this dictionary, collected by Buechel from fluent speakers, but there is also equally as much, or even more, data that is highly problematic and in fact incorrect. Unless you are a native speaker of the language you won't be able to tell the valuable data from the inaccurate text. During the 20 years of our work on the New Lakota Dictionary (New Lakota Dictionary) over 300 fluent native speaker were involved in checking words from the Buechel dictionary (apart from other sources) and this work revealed that a large percentage of the Buechel dictionary entries are highly problematic, for one reason or another.Most of the words in this dictionary were actually borrowed from the Dakota dictionary published by Riggs in 1852. The Riggs dictionary contains some 21,000 word entries and Buechel's around 24,000 entries. The two dictionaries overlap in approximately 18,000 entries, and in about 15,500 of them Buechel's definitions are identical to those given by Riggs. Although Dakota and Lakota are very closely related, their significant lexical differences do not always allow Lakota words to be generated by applying Lakota phonetics to Dakota words. This, however, is precisely what Buechel did in a large number of cases.The Reverend Paul Manhart S.J. who edited the manuscript after Buechel's death, made highly controversial editorial decisions, in particular he changed Buechel's accurate spelling system with a very complex system of diacritical marks. Yet, to make it worse, the conversion was done inconsistently resulting in completely unreliable spelling. In the first edition of the Buechel dictionary, published by the Red Cloud School, the diacritics that Manhart didn't manage to omit were at least legible. In this edition by Nebraska Press they are hardly so and the whole spelling problem is made so much worse.This Lakota dictionary is unreliable for a number of reasons, some of which are mentioned above. If you want to read more details you can find them in the introduction to the New Lakota Dictionary.

His contributions to the poets who came after him, and to literature in general, are persistently evident. Eliot doesn't always succeed, and many of his poems seem trite and pretentious, but when he succeeds he hits dead on with poetry perfect in form, balance, and sound. There is the man here, the poet as reflected in his own work, but there is also common human experience through looking at history (&quot;The Waste Land&quot;) and meditating on Man's relationship with the Divine and the eternal (Ariel Poems, and most of his output after 1928).

Whether one swallows DHC's views on Atlantis or the 'Osirian Empire' is really beside the point, as this book's value lies primarily in its entertaining and evocative travelogue, not in any pretensions to accuracy. Even if DHC's theories are completely bogus, his books still make entertaining reading.The reviewers who dismiss DHC's books as worthless because he isn't a scientist and engages in speculation (sample sentence: "1932 was a good year for mysterious ancient roads in Kenya") are themselves remarkably clown-like in their earnest simplicity. The book provides an argument against them in the form of a great quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: "for God's sake give me a young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself!"Previous African travelogues I read include Shiva Naipaul's 'North of South' and Paul Theroux's 'Dark Star Safari', both of them sardonic, near-misanthropic works. While DHC doesn't have a literary style to match those accomplished authors, his wide-eyed optimism and childlike sense of adventure at least make an interesting contrast to the jaded cynicism of Naipaul and Theroux.As one would expect from someone who has hitchhiked through the Middle East and Africa, DHC is full of entertaining travel tales and encounters with amusing characters, like the Palestinian truck driver he gets a lift with in Jordan who makes an unexpected stop at a tent in the desert, which turns out to be a brothel, then emerges minutes later zipping his pants up, saying "no good, no good..."In Israel he is taken to hospital with gangrene, and just as he is about to be treated, finds the place is suddenly deserted. The doctors have all gone home for the sabbath, and he has to wait another two days for treatment...One part of the book that intrigued me dealt with the mysterious Tuaregs of the Ahaggar mountains in southern Algeria. Their chief town is called Tamanrasset (i.e. Taman-Ra-Set)...a survival of ancient Egyptian paganism in a remote pocket of the Islamic world? The Arabs are said to be afraid of these mountains, and many eerie and surrealistic tales are told of them.DHC's book will appeal to those who like hitchhiking travel stories, or those who like esoteric speculation (or both). I doubt it will appeal to puritanical empiricists, but there are plenty of other books they can read instead.

Upon reading his book, I found him to be knowledgeable about Islamic history, but confused on Islamic motives. He is neither reasonable nor rational. His book is very biased. He cannot conceal his hatred for America, Christians, Israel, Jews, and the West in general. His book is laced with Marxist "code words" to the extent that he is rendered totally not credible. He explains that the US supported the Muslims in Afghanistan and trained Muslims to fight the Russian Army in the 1980's, and that somehow that caused them to later become terrorists against their former allies. He puts forth many specious arguments. It is true that we trained them to fight against the Soviet Army, but we did not train them or send them out to terrorize non-combatants located in Moscow, Leningrad, or anywhere else in the world. He cannot make the argument that providing support for their struggle against the Russians, we corrupted the morals and the sense of right and wrong of all Muslims to the extent that they now don't know the difference between a Soviet Army invading Afghanistan and innocent citizens of the Western World. Does he want us to believe that Muslims have no free will? Are Muslims so malleable and gullible that they cannot distinguish between events that occurred a thousand years ago during the Crusades and the geo-politics of today? The author seems to want to make that argument. I don't buy any of it.

The book was a fast paced, easy-to-read book but the plot just did not grab me at all. I bought this book because I was told how great it was but, after I was finished reading it, I felt like I read a different book than my friends. My major problem with the book, and thus the 3 star rating, was the plot was just too predictable. I felt like the book took way too long to get to the conclusion I could see coming after about the first 30 to 40 pages.

Until the advent of mass-produced texts, endorsements came by way of large sums of money or time, or both. Therefore, if we do not understand what Euclid is writing about, there is overwhelming evidence that this failure is ours, not Euclid's. If we decry the unfamiliarity of Euclid's way of reasoning and his manner of writing his mathematics as being less clear or efficient than our own, we are simply expressing our faith--perhaps misplaced--in our own mathematical culture. Clearly, if one's purpose is to learn geometric techniques and results, other books may serve as well or better; if one's purpose is to understand mathematics, the thirteen books of the Elements are without equal.The Heath edition of Euclid's Elements actually consists of three volumes: volume 1 has Euclid's Books I and II; Heath's volume 2 contains Euclid's Books III - IX; and his volume 3 encompasses Euclid's remaining Books X - XIII. Books VII, VIII, and IX are about "arithmetic," not "geometry"--a feature of the Elements often left unstated. Throughout, Heath intersperses his notes and comments, so the three volumes actually consist of as much Heath as Euclid. (Just Heath's translation, alone, is reproduced in the Great Books of the Western World, published in 1952 by University of Chicago.) Up until recently, maybe as late as the nineteenth century, a typical reader of Euclid would be quite familiar with Plato and therefore know that arithmetic and geometry are the philosophical branches of mathematics; music and astronomy are the remaining branches of mathematics, although somewhat contaminated since--in the Greek understanding as expressed by Plato--music and astronomy introduce motion, which is not strictly a mathematical topic.Niceties such as these, and there are many others, would be lost to us if Euclid were transformed by using modern symbolism. Consider proposition 47 of Book I, the so-called Pythagorean theorem: Euclid talks about constructing squares on the sides of a triangle and never even hints at the possibility of the sides being "numbers." In fact, Euclid and all of his notable contemporaries and successors up to about the 15th century would consider the term "irrational number" as utter nonesensical babble--something more dangerous than an oxymoron such as a "square circle" because "square" and "circle" are not fundamental ideas. These comments may raise more questions than they purport to answer, but they give background to reviewing Heath, rather than Euclid.Heath's edition, taken in toto, would have been very difficult to improve. His notes and collecting together of earlier commentaries represent a remarkable achievement in scholarship. He certainly made errors, but he provided nearly the best edition of Euclid possible at the opening of the last century. Heath made several efforts to explain the contents of Euclid by appealing to contemporary ideas and notations and, at least for me, these explanations simply reinforced the view that Euclid dealt with profound unanswerable questions that remain unanswered in contemporary mathematics.Heath translated and edited several Greek primary sources, including Archimedes and Apollonius. Comparing his earlier translations with his later (in his career) Euclid, one immediately sees that Heath tried to preserve more faithfully Euclid's manner of speaking than he did Apollonius's or Archimedes'. This historigraphic point is important: if we are to respect the ancient Greeks by trying to understand or know their culture and values on their terms, we must have access to their culture with as few filters as possible. This line of arguing suggests that we should first study ancient Greek and then read Euclid, perhaps an ideal approach. Very few readers of Euclid take this approach. Hence, for an English reader (which includes readers of many other languages), a more faithful rendering of the Greek into English has greater importance because it does not filter the implicit culture as much as a less faithful rendering.These views are my historian views. As a mathematician, I think of mathematics as timeless and critique any mathematical work on the basis of whether it represents good (read this as "my") mathematics. Heath knew his mathematics; he frequently calls on ideas from Cantor, who at this time is in the middle of his seminal publications. I would take the same critical approach if I were a philosopher--is Euclid good philosophy in that he provides answers to philosophical questions, regardless of whether many refinements have been formulated since Euclid? (By the way, there is no explicit philosophy in Euclid, but a lot of implicit philosophy.) In terms of editing a crucial historical document, Heath's work has withstood the test of about one century, and rightly so in my judgment. His Euclid is likely found among the personal books of people with a high regard for education.

Libertarian economics is quite sensible stuff, though there are a couple of interesting ansatzes that are quite false.The main bad idea is that the market is rational. A free market does not choose the best price via the laws of supply and demand. While supply and demand factor in, cartels, monopolies, advertising, irrational exuberance, war, quasi-religious crazes (c.f. cabbage patch dolls or whatever kids toy people go wild for now a days) all factor into prices. This isn't idle theorizing on my part: I make my living on this fact.Another falsehood is that governmentally funded projects are somehow inherently evil. The author goes to great lengths to "prove" this. I find it absurd (though, to be fair, I have worked for a governmentally funded project). Virtually all scientific and technological progress since the 1940s has been the result of a governmentally funded project. Most infrastructure since the 1930s; dams, bridges, highways has been a result of same. I can't argue much with his assertion that various ham-handed governmental interferences with the economy (price-fixing, industry bail-outs, etc) are silly and rarely work. Those have generally been disasters. But, for example, microchips and the internet seem to be pretty useful. Perhaps it wasn't as easy to see this in Hazlitt's era. Certainly some people still make this argument.

Yes, some of them are ridiculous (crocheted bikini - wtf?) but the majority of them are things I would at least consider making and they are definitely better and more modern than most crochet patterns out there. However my problem is with how the book is packaged/marketed. On the cover, I see Debbie Stoller is huge letters. Most people are buying this book for the patterns, not for the lame how-to. Trying to teach yourself to crochet will drive most people absolutely crazy - trust me, I've tried. So I think most buyers of the book already know how to crochet. Therefore, we're using the pattern section of the book which isn't by Debbie Stoller. She's wearing the cowboy hat on the front which by the way is 1. cute and 2. made with value-priced Red Heart yarn. Oh and the pattern is not by her. So would it be so hard to actually say that they book is edited by Stoller, not written by her?I just think credit should go to the pattern creators because they are the ones who actually make this book worth buying, not the "author."

Rather than defend himself against charges of immorality, he pointed out that the multitude are wrong.Dr. Stockmann, a stand-in for Ibsen's views, wants to do the right thing, the moral thing, to tell the truth to the people of his town, a truth that they do not want to hear. He is the medical advisor of the town's health baths, baths that brings wealth to the community. He discovers that the bath water is contaminated because the town officials, against his advice, set the pipes in a wrong place, and the water flowing through the area is causing bathers to become sick. The cost of repairing the pipes is enormous and it would take two years to fix them. The doctor is stopped from revealing the problem to his community by the Mayor, his older brother, who was interested in his health, but not in the health of others, who insisted that the doctor be silent because the community wants the money that the baths will bring, doesn't want to pay the large repair costs, and leaving the baths unused for two years would result in a large financial loss to the community.Ibsen dramatizes the situation by making Dr. Stockmann somewhat flawed. The doctor naively persues his quest without using persuasive techniques to win over the town.The town newspaper and the home owners are behind the doctor until the Mayor explains the enormous loss to them. Then, as with Ibsen who described moral problems in Ghosts, the entire town turns against Dr. Stockmann and vilifies him, calling him a lunatic and an enemy of the people. He tries to explain that he is telling the truth, but the town people refuse to see it. The town argues that they are the majority and they determine what is right. This is reminiscent of the Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas, who is not mentioned in the play, who insisted on holding the community and the church above the individual.Stockmann responds that in matters of right and wrong, the individual is superior to the will of the many. In a memorable line, he says, "A minority may be right; a majority is always wrong."

This time the weapon is a missile full of anthrax and sarin, a neurotoxin. A miracle occurs and the missile crashes through a window in the United Nations Building traveling backwards. It fails to explode. The ensuing investigation reveals the missile was built in Russia during the Cold War. FBI Russian expert William Cowley is assigned to work closely with an old friend, Dimitri Danilov, one of Moscow's top men in the investigation of organized crime.Working first on opposite sides of the Atlantic, and then together, the two men unravel a crazy quilt plot of Russian gangsters and American ultra right wing hackers, which masks an even more obscure story of political maneuvering and infighting. Time after time, new evidence seems to obscure, rather than clarify, the case. It seems that the criminals ability to plan and execute is only marred by their occasional poor choices of weapons. In the meantime agents die and Cowley and Danilov seem powerless to make and progress.The third player on the investigation team is FBI agent Pamela Darnley. She works with Cowley and heads the U.S. investigation when he is in Russia. To say that Darnley is ambitious is an understatement, but she is intelligent and determined, and is responsible for many of the case's breakthroughs. Since Cowley and Danilov were originally introduced in "No Time For Heroes" most of the character development is lavished on Darnley. The reader will find her an intriguing and unusual character.I find I like novels in the spy genre best when they most resemble police procedurals, and that is what "The Watchmen" excels at. Plotting is tight as the story shifts back and forth from Russia to the States. There are countless puzzle pieces, but the solutions are logical rather than magical. And nobody has superpowers, either. Other than slight flaws due to minimalistic character development this is a very readable story that echoes and extremely uncomfortable reality.("The Watchmen" was actually conceived and written before the events of 9/11. In the light of that tragedy, portions of the book had to be revised to reflect that harsh reality.)

While reading the book I kept asking the question, why are these facts and consequences not part of the American psyche? Yes I know our current administration excels in marketing its distorted hegemonic view of the world, and framing all debate, which is willingly lapped up by a beguiled public. But we should use the resources of the media to try to make this become an agenda item in the political debate over the next four years, so we are first able to elect an administration that would take a constructive world leadership role as adeptly described in this book. Many quality periodicals are already talking about the impact of oil on our economy (National Geographic), can readers of this article, and the author get articles into Newsweek, Time, USA Today eg.? Last year there was a movie about rapid global warming/cooling and while it was Hollywood-ized, people now know about it, they also know about killer asteroids, both of which are much less likely to shock us, than the impact of the changes to be wrought in the transition to the post-petroleum world. Also, I'm sure authors such as Tom Clancy could draft a fantastic movie-ready book around the very themes of this book, which in a way truly is the Sum of all Fears.

It gives the reader a gentle introduction to the subject. The proofs are rigorous and easy to follow. Before embarking upon an analysis class, a person should take an introduction to proof class. Without such a class, the language of analysis will make no sense to the reader. For example, if you do not know how to do proof by induction, then you will struggle in analysis. The negative reviews for this book likely stem from readers who did not take such a class. Thanks to this book and Munkres' topology, I am now able to read and enjoy Baby Rudin. Baby Rudin is good, but I would not have liked it without first using Munkres and Gaughan. Note that Gaughan is not a complete substitute for Rudin. Rudin is general whereas Gaughan focuses mainly on the real line. Albeit, Gaughan is much easier on a reader who is new to the subject. Gaughan's treatment of sequences sets the stage for the book. He then goes into continuity and uniform continuity. The definitions and theorems are lucid. Gaughan then delves into differentiation, integration, and power series. The ordering of the topics allows the reader to move from topic to topic without having to flip back and forth through the book.

Many sections just aren't that interesting, but where else are you going to find this info.One thing I was surprised to learn from this book, is that grizzlies will actually come attack and eat people. Never knew that. Always thought they just defended.I am dismayed at how park rangers seem to assume people being at fault in some of these tragedies. It seems very presumptuous. Like the cameraman bear attack, they just state he was probably too close to the bear, with out any REAL proof. Other accounts of other tragedies have this same ranger disposition.

To date, I think I own about four different copies of Whitman's grand opus "Leaves of Grass". One is a deathbed edition, printed in 1922, that is hardcover yet pocket sized and great for a backpack. The second is an 1855 reprint of a "first edition" sold by a major bookstore chain. The third is another 1855 reprint in paperback. And now the fourth, which is this one, and without a doubt, the best of the bunch!Walt Whitman, throughout his years, wrote and rewrote Leaves of Grass many times, for each subsequent reprint. Much of the later editions of the book become watered down and less potent, according to editor Gary Schmidgall, of which I heartily agree. The final "deathbed" edition of Leaves of Grass, released around the time of Whit's death, varies tremendously from the rich dance of the first edition, in fact, the first three editions.After reading Schmidgall's amazing book, "Walt Whitman: A Gay Life", you come quickly appreciate Whitman's 1860 edition of the book, the third, released just before the Civil War. Upon searching for a copy of this book, it's virtually hard to find, and I ended up downloading some of the poetry off the Whitman archives website. But Schmidgall painstakingly has recreated that edition, rebuilding such moving sections of the book like Calamus.It's in Schmidgall's edition that the true genius of Whitman comes alive. He becomes more real, more in depth, and shows more pain than in any other edition I've read. It's too bad that Whit decided to censor his writings as he aged, for he tends to weed out the roses with the dandelions. Schmidgall replants Whitman's glorious garden, and we, as readers, get to reap the visual brilliance of it all.

It _might_ be an attempt at humour however it merely succeeds in being tiresome. The book also assaults you with trite banalities such as having gravity discovered by someone called 'oldgram' (new-ton .. get it). As a general rule anyone who resorts to witless-isms like this can't have much to say. Had to put it down. Maybe I'll finish it when I'm desperate for reading material and I've finished all the adds in the paper. Pity really, I _like_ Eric Flint's other work.

As compared to big research universities, their professors are less likely to be distracted by big-city pretensions and obsequious grad students. The small-college ideal is what much of America likes to think higher education once was and should be again.Kluge, in this touching, sardonic reconsideration of his own alma mater, Kenyon College (the book is essentially a diary of the year he spent back in Gambier, Ohio, as a visiting professor), shows us that the reality of a real liberal arts college -- its ghosts, aspirations, conceits, compromises -- is far more complicated. Its history and traditions are as much a curse as a blessing. The dignified, self-knowing exterior it presents to prospective students and the public may mask self-doubts, intrigues, identity crises. For faculty as well as students, small size and intimacy means academic and cultural debates are more difficult to avoid, the stakes higher, the joys and sorrows more intensely personal.Though not the author's primary purpose, Alma Mater provides a rich and interpretive portrait of contemporary American academic culture. Today a college like Kenyon, isolated though it may be by geography, is awash in the same turmoils as the biggest and most unwieldy Research I institution: race, gender, fraternities, curriculum, faculty roles and rewards, and, as always, money. Just as TV and computers have virtually wiped out traditional regional cultures, so journals, conferences, and faculty mobility assure that professors in vastly different settings will be wrestling with the same ideas, controversies, and alienations.Kluge's vivid, indeed exquisite, writing draws out larger truths behind quotidian events and observations. Office corridors strangely dark and deserted in the middle of a weekday become a metaphor for faculty overspecialization (increasingly treated like free agents, professors ply their little projects in solitude from home) and the consequent loss of campus collegiality and sense of community. Figures at a faculty meeting seem to come from some central casting of academic types and images. And anyone who has taught a college course would empathize with Kluge's take on grading: &quot;Splattering comments on papers, you sense you are working harder on grading than they ever did on writing, that you are obliged to take seriously what they took casually.&quot;To his bemusement, Kluge, ultimately discovers he can't go home again. But he gives us a loving and richly detailed portrait of the inner life of a college he still loves, a &quot;good place,&quot; and we understand why.

I have seen several negative reviews about this book, and that's ok. some people don't want to have their precious castles in the sky brought down to Earth. but for the rest of us, we have this wonderful book.I think the major advantage to this book is that it was written by a non-pagan. He cannot be accused of revisionism, nor can he be accused of choosing one form of Witchcraft over another. He is outside the &quot;Witch Wars&quot;, and that helps him greatly. He is a historian with nothing to gain or lose from debunking the &quot;wicca-is-as-old-as-man&quot; myth. finally!Hutton discusses a number of names in the history of the Craft, both big and small. Gardner, Sanders, Crowley, Valiente, Murray, Graves..none are immune from either Hutton's praise or question. I suspect that what most people find so good about this book is the sheer number of people the author has spoken to in addition to the number of texts he has read.Several people have accused Hutton of tunnel-vision. here is my reply. if your idea of history is some pseudo-scientific drivel, you're welcome to it! Graves rewrote the myth of Hekate, Gardner borrowed whatever he could from every source availible to him, Leland may have been wrong and mislead a la Mead, and Murray made up a lot of her statistics and revised a lot of history. what disturbs these reviewers isn't that Hutton is right or wrong, but that the &quot;Gospel of Gardner/Leland/Murray/Graves&quot; has been challenged.it is about time that someone stepped up to the plate and gave the world a book such as this. new doesn't equal bad, i don't know why some of these reviewers are all wound up. my only complaint about the book...Oxford Press: could you have made the print any smaller?!?

Although some previous knowledge of the fields investigated does help, this book serves as a great introduction into such things as perspective geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, network theory, topology and quantum mechanincs. It also provides some great insights into the history and uses of number theory, algebra, geometry and calculus. I've have never read a mathematical/scientific work that was written with such passion and was a complete page turner (I read it straight over the course of 3 days).

I got the first edition of Buechel's 15 years ago and and used it as my main reference book for the Lakota language for many years. Then I learned that Buechel borrowed most of the lexicon and definitions from Riggs Dakota dictionary, simply used it as a starting point, changing all "d" and "md" into "l" and "bl" etc.It is not easy to learn the language using the "Beegle". Spelling is inconsistent, not all aspirations are shown, not all changeable -A's are shown by examples, the definitions are not always adequate and accurate.The Second edition is generally a step back. The spelling turned into "traditional" one and trascription enclosed in slashes is even less consistent. Aspirations of [c^h] as opposted to [c^] are altogether dropped this time.Most word entries don't have examples, the ablaut (changing word-final -a to -e or -iN) can be checked only IF examples are present - unless the examples are incorrect, as it is for "agla, v.coll.pl": 'mis eya wakiyagla na...' - should be actually 'mis eya wakiyagni na..'For decades this was the only Lakota dictionary of a decent size available and so it was a must-have for the students of the language. But now theNew Lakota Dictionaryhas taken the position of the standard reference dictionary on Lakota. It has all the necessary features of a modern dictionary, reliable spelling based on a standard orthography, conjugations, sentence examples and other things that Buechel's dictionary lacks. The introduction in the new dictionary explains in much detail the history of Lakota lexicography including why the Buechel material is unreliable.

Its main contention is precise and powerful: the family structure of competitive career-oriented fathers and obsessive fastidious mothers, a school system that is too happily ready to harshly discipline boys without providing them emotional support, and a society which has a narrow mindset of what manliness entails and thus imprisons boys in a "culture of cruelty" are conspiring to wreck the emotional lives of boys. The hell-raising and risk-taking testosterone-driven stereotype of boys has some basis in nature, but it's mainly created by nurture.To understand the inner world of boys today consider what they read and what they're exposed to in popular culture. Frank Miller's graphic novels -- "Sin City" and "300" -- are extremely popular among boys, and these novels are brimming with violence, fear, hatred, disgust, and contempt. Or how about sports such as football where sports commentators don't emphasize intelligence and teamwork but raw instinctive brutality and violence? Then there is the hip hop music of black gangsters that resonate so powerfully with white middle-class boys.There's a striking anecdote that the authors use to illustrate this "culture of cruelty" : a school's lacrosse team gathers two young ninth-graders after school, and forces them to fight. That really is a metaphor for how society develops boys, and to counterbalance this the authors propose another metaphor. In a park, a mother sits on a bench and watches her young three-year old ward learn to explore the world around him. He takes a few steps before scattering back to his mother's embrace, and confident that she will be his anchor he musters the courage to explore the world a bit further. The mother knows that the world will only offer dangers and challenges for her young son, and deep inside is afraid of losing him to the world -- but strengthened and armored by her love she lets him go so that he may become a man.This is an affecting and effective metaphor for how we should raise boys. Some boys are shackled in their mother's strong embrace, and that only forces them to rebel in anger and frustration. Many more boys are simply abandoned emotionally -- they're forced to defend for themselves, and confused and alone they often turn to anger and violence, because that's the socially acceptable path."Raising Cain" implores parents and teachers to equip young boys with an emotional language that they can use to be more aware of themselves and to confront their mixed feelings. Teachers should be just as nurturing and as sensitive towards boys as they are towards girls, and parents ought to give each boy room to discover his own individuality while always setting strong guidelines to ensure that he also develops socially. Above all, boys should be encouraged to communicate, and while it's true that boys aren't as verbally gifted as girls it's even more true that adults don't make any effort to see the world from the perspective of boys."Raising Cain" is an extremely liberal tract in an increasingly conservative America, and will provoke parents and educators into questioning the status quo of a sports-dominated culture, test-oriented schools, and a very competitive goal-oriented workplace.

One reviewer complained that the authors overemphasized the importance of limiting T.V., and reading to kids, but I am a teacher and can tell you that many parents don't bother to take those basic but crucial steps with their kids. The authors offer a good analysis of the problems with public education today (which both parents and schools can contribute to), but their main solution to the problems of the educational system is standardized testing. As a teacher in Texas, where high-stakes testing rules the public school system, I have learned that placing such overwhelming emphasis on an annual test does not raise the standards of students' educations; it has actually caused too many schools to teach to the test, cheat, and neglect the needs of gifted students in order to prep the slower ones for the tests.

One easily forgets that this is the book that opened the way to new approaches to Shakespeare's plays. When my students want to write about the importance of ceremony or about women or about marriage in Shakespeare's plays, I first send them to *Broken Nuptials*. It's nicely written with no twisted inane jargon to trip up even a novice reader. Most readers, in fact, may end the book thinking &quot;I knew that!&quot; (although they probably didn't know it when they started the book). The insights appear to be so self-evident (and so colored by work done after the book's publication) that I believe readers and scholars, while recognizing the book's importance, have underrated its quality. This book is an excellent tool that stands the test of time.

Boyer and Nissenbaum look at every possible contributing factor to the witch craze that took hold of Salem in the late 17th century. They are careful to present all of the data upon which they based their hypotheses, allowing the reader to judge the validity of their claims. Salem Possessed provides an enlightening look at the pressures (social, economic, religious) that affected all of the villagers, and manages not to vilify any particular person.This book's strength is it's thoroughness, but it is also it's major drawback.

That's where those of you really interested in Hemingway will find their interest. There are a couple of things in this book that you'd not expect, such as some short stories and some dissertations on art and what it is to write. Hemingway compares bullfight to writing in some passages and the area of death in relation to people is dealt with to some extent.I would not recommend this book unless you want to know about bullfight.

His writing style is, at best, witty and sarcastic. He gives us the meanings of the cards (at face value) and leaves us to figure out the rest.Of course, Tarot has undergone several changes and has had several associations with all the abovementioned doctrines. The meanings have gone through a radical change; and correctly so, since all associations with the cards pictures and archetypes must change over time.All in all, it is a wonderful book for someone who is interested in the roots of Tarot - especially connected to his deck - which forms the basis for anyone who is interested in learning the Tarot.On a more personal note: I like the wit and sarcasm of Mr. Waite. Had I been alive back then, I would certainly have written to him personally about this!

Before you start whacking out large amounts of cash on bits and pieces of software, recording gear, and a PC which may or may not be suited to the task, I suggest you get as big a picture as possible. It will help you to intelligently build a PC-based studio, rather than haphazardly collecting modules based solely on individual recommendations or specs.I almost embarrassedly endorse "PC Recording for Dummies". Yup, finally had to admit I wuz one. I know recording, I know computers, but trying to do one with the other was topping me. Unless the book has been updated recently, it will be a little dated in terms of hardware model numbers and software versions, but most of the brand names still exist and all of the principles still apply. It was instrumental (hey, if there's a pun, I meant it) in leading me toward the stable, capable Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) I have today.Author Jeff Strong writes in an annoyingly cutesy style, but he knows his stuff. The book is well organized and systematically takes you through the steps of assessing your needs, acquiring gear and software, and putting it together and making it work.I originally wrote a version of this review for the forum at PG Music, manufacturers of "Band in a Box", "Power Tracks Pro Audio" and "RealBand", which are unfortunately not mentioned in the book. Even the dated price points of competitive software will make you appreciate the bargain that PG products represent.I take off one star for syrupy-cute delivery and being somewhat out of date, but the information is all solid. A bargain in its own right, and for what it will save you in time and wise buying decisions.RyszardAtlanta GA

I think it's fine to acknowledge the differences between men and women,in fact I'd like to see more discussion about this, especially the biological aspects. But why not show how both sexes have strengths and weaknesses, and how they compliment each other? Instead Fisher fills page after page claiming that women are superior at almost every task, and in most cases provides supporting arguments that are weak. Talents of males are mentioned as an afterthought. And of course in the 21st century the supposedly limited skill set of males will no longer be needed. I suppose many female readers will eat this up, but discrimination is discrimination, no matter where it's directed. The prose is quite choppy, kind of surprising, given the innately superior language abilities of women. She must have had a male editor.

Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc. This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island. The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes." ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.) Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion. We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course. Yet the book does not fulfill its promise. My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for.

If you've never studied, but are interested in learning about math, find an easier introduction and save this for your 3rd or fourth book, when you're ready to see how math helps us understand abstract ideas even before they have real world application.

(Whitman himself acknowledged that his style was all-too readily parodied.) It was only when, 30 years ago, I heard Rip Torn read it, I began to acknowledge its power and originality. Nevertheless, I was still bothered by an overly self-aware, "straining for effect" quality -- until I found this collection.Gary Schmidgall has done what should have been done a century ago. His collection, comprising half of Whitman's poems (about 80% of the total number of lines he wrote), restores them to their first versions in the correct chronological sequence.We now hear Whitman speaking to us with his original animal vigor. Whitman himself admitted this: "...there was an immediateness to the 1855 edition, an incisive directness, that was perhaps not repeated in any section of poems subsequently added to the book: a hot, unqualifying temper, an insulting arrogance (to use a few strong words) that would not have been as natural to the periods that followed. We miss the ecstasy of statement in some of the after-work..."More significantly, Whitman's subsequent emasculation and de-sexualizing -- to confuse and obscure the issue of his sexuality -- is removed. Whitman's originals are often more graphic, more-bluntly sexual. It's easier to see why most critics were offended. It's unfortunate Whitman's changes to "Leaves of Grass" made it less controversial. Perhaps the Schmidgall edition will encourage libraries that ban "Huckleberry Finn" to also ban "Leaves of Grass."If you haven't read the original, 1855 edition of "Leaves of Grass" -- as well as Whitman's unsigned (and bluntly meretricious) reviews, and the contemporary reviews of academic critics -- you haven't read Whitman. I was especially moved by the last few pages of "Song of Myself," which I had never read.Schmidgall includes a copious quantity of notes, excerpts, and reviews. The material from Whitman's notebooks make it clear he knew exactly what he was doing -- creating a new, original, wholly American poetry not modeled on Classic, European, or British forms -- and why. If America is the land of self-definition, Whitman was the first American poet to make that self-centeredness the focus of his works.This edition is a must-own for anyone with the least interest in Whitman. Or dis-interest, for that matter. You might change your mind.

In this he succeeds brilliantly, in a work of elegant, convincing logic, and clearly laid out insights. There is no new information in this book, nor does it take sides in political differences, but it re-arranges what you already know and have seen in your life in a manner that decisively delivers new understanding of the world around you.Mr. Sowell's thesis is that most people fall into two idealized "visions" of human nature, what he calls the constrained (which also been called the Tragic and is generally linked with conservatives) and the unconstrained (which has also been called the Utopian and is generally linked with liberals) visions. These visions are basically intuitive (to the person who holds them, and usually anathema to the person that holds the opposing), and more or less "gut feelings" on the nature of humanity and human potential. In reality the visions individuals hold lie on a spectrum of level of constraint and although no one person would hold a 100% constrained or 100% unconstrained vision it is implicitly assumed that there is a double bump distribution of people along this spectrum, with about half holding mostly constrained visions, half holding mostly unconstrained visions, and not too many people holding a middle position. This is because the two visions are opposed and to hold equal belief in both would be logically contradictory. From his characterization of each vision the author clearly explains how the assumptions undergirding each lead to completely different conceptions in how each side even defines such issues as freedom, equality, justice and power, and why both sides argue past each other and have such a difficult time debating / convincing each other.The constrained visions basically sees man's nature as both fixed and as incapable of predicting the results of his actions in the complex world, and thus incapable of controlling those results. As such it relies on systemic measures to promote the general good of society, for example evolutionary developments of such things as free-markets, constitutional government with strict constructionist judicial interpretation, great intelligence inherited in social traditions, etc. The unconstrained vision on the other hand sees man's nature as changeable in response to articulated rationality, and sees man as not only capable of predicting the results of his actions but morally obligated to control the results of his actions for the greater good. Thus the unconstrained vision places emphasis on bodies of "surrogate" decision makers of the most intelligent to control economic and social policy for the greater good, activist judicial interpretation of law to provide the best outcome for the individual case at hand, social activism like recycling, and great intelligence inherited in the most intellectually and developed individuals of our society.The insights of the book are truly worthwhile and cover far more than I could here in a review. However, the book is not long and not too difficult to read, although it is written in a slightly dense intellectual manner which can take a few pages to get used to and is a bit repetitive. Nonetheless this is a book that will make you smarter, better able to understand where someone from an opposing political viewpoint is coming from as well as better able to understand your own viewpoint and its foundation in how you perceive, consciously or not, the character of human nature. The book is also extremely fair to each side, not trying to prove one or the other correct, but just trying to explain how each thinks and reaches the conclusions they do.Highly recommended!

I'm also a casual runner (a few runs of 3-5 miles each per week), and I have some minor issues with my back and hips. I've found the book very helpful in keeping my hips, pelvis, and back more steady and stable when I run. I was usually at the chiropractor every few months or so when something would slip a little out of whack, but after just a cursory read of this book and applying a few of the principles, I didn't go back to the doctor for several months. (Of course, consult with your own doctor.) I was also experiencing some burn-out, but this book has given me new focus, and now I'm considering trying a half-marathon just to see if I could finish.I think most runners, serious or not, will find new ways to think about posture and form in this book. The author is an ultra-marathoner and claims to have been injury-free for several years, so I had to see what that was about. I haven't been disappointed. Anyone participating in any sport should be thinking about correct form, and this book offers an excellent approach. I remain a casual runner (despite my flirtation with the upcoming half-marathon), but now I'm a more confident casual runner.

Heinrich	9	16	2003-12-24 23:49:33+08	The criticisms of this book are flawed	Rather than explaining why this is a good book (other revierw's do that), I'll explain why some of the idiotic criticisms levied against this book are wrong.The most silly criticism of Hazlitt (and other Austrian free-market economists) is that they aren't &quot;scientific&quot; and in short &quot;don't use enough math&quot;. This is an absurd criticism. Firstly, human beings are not deterministic particles who's behaviour can be predicted by simple equations. Any attempt to reduce human behaviour to some mathematical equation is pure non-sense. We must consider human beings as individual entities who can choose, not fixed constants in mathematical formuli.Secondly, there is a mathematics that is relevant to Austrians. It is chaos theory and network theory. Chaos theory is currently used to predict the weather. The calculus used by Keynes and other idiots like him is completely useless for describing the behaviour of chaotic systems where individual choice is involved. Hazlitt may not mention Chaos Theory. For that, see Murray N. Rothbard, &quot;Choas Theory: Destroying Mathematics from Within?&quot;; and Gene Callahan, &quot;Why Austrians Should Care About Network Science&quot;. Anyone with any sympathy for Keynes and his idiotic followers should note that Keynes put forth a &quot;treatise&quot; before General Theory, which was demolished by Hayek. Hayek then made a strategical mistake in not demolishing General Theory, feeling that the book's idiocy stood for itself. Also note that while Hayek recieved a Nobel Prize for work which was basically an extension of Mises business cycle theory (Mises died the year before Hayek's Nobel), Keynes received no Nobel, showing that even the dimwits awarding that title realized Keynes work was inherently worthless.The next criticism is related to the first: that Hazlitt doesn't discuss game theory. The reason for this is that game theory is particularly unworthy of discussion. Nash, founder of Game Theory, showed that in any finite game, there's an equilibrium in which no player can improve his or her outcome given the other player's strategies (the Nash Equilibrium). This is problematic in several ways. Firstly, there is absolutely no relation between the playing of games (which are less than net-zero, with one winner and one or more losers) and economics. Secondly, only Game Therorists behave in real situations in the ways in which Game Theory predicts. Thirdly, strategies are not data, but choices. Fourth, it is possible to break out of the specified game to achieve a superior result.One particularly ignorant reviewer says that in a completely unhampered free market, monopolies form, destroying competition. This is non-sense. Empirically, Ancient Ireland was a completely Stateless society for a thousand years, with a completely unhampered free market, and no-such thing occured. And of course it is a bunch of non-sense that can't happen in reality anyeways. A monopoly is only harmful if you have monopoly prices. But in a completely free market, even if someone obtains 100% of all (say) rail-roads, there is still competition between that form of transportation and other forms, thus monopoly prices cannot be charged. The only time real monopolies with monopoly pricing have emerged is because of State interference.This may not be the best book on economics that you can read (look to Mises' &quot;Human Action&quot; for what is most likely the strongest treatise on &quot;economics&quot; [actually praxeology, a much larger field]) ever written.

That this is indispensible to any theoretical physicist is pretty much the extent of what I am about to say. I mean, here you have the greatest scientific giants of all time grappling with some of the deepest, most complicated issues of 20th century physics: you not only get the opportunity of finding out what they really thought about relativity, with all mathematical and philosophical details, but you also are able to see how truly great minds go about solving difficult problems (which, I feel, should be an inspiration for modern theoreticians as to how to solve the problems associated with quantum gravity, string theory, etc.). Just the section of Einstein's paper The Foundations of a General Relativity Theory on the deep, philosophical reasons why a theory of nature should be generaly relativistic are well worth getting this book; I personally think that this one paper is the greatest scientific publication of all time (Principia is certainly bolder, more revolutionary, but Einstein's deepest ruminations, I feel, are almost religious). To be sure, one needs certain mathematical training to get the full benefit of this book, but this could be said of relativity in general; I personally do not think that one can fully comprehend relativity theory, in all its beautiful glory, without this training. Despite this, I still think it is possible, even without sufficient mathematical training, to get a real feel of how these titans thought and felt, even if just by osmosis (you know that profound thoughts are being expressed when you can almost grasp them without really understanding them). In short, it is the duty of every physicist, maybe even every scientist, not just to read, but to EXPERIENCE this book (that is the only way I can adequately describe this; it is an experience).

Yet pleasurable because now I'm finally starting to realize what's going on with women, what it is that they're REALLY thinking (not what they're just saying they're thinking), what they really want in a man, what turns them on and what turns them off, and how to be the man women really want.All I can say is how come we guys didn't have this book 10 or more years ago? But I guess better late than never:)

No big deal really, except that there is no title or any mark at all on the book's spine. Sitting on my shelf among hundreds of books, I tend to like to see the title. Worst of all, the print is unusually small. I'm by no means far-sighted and the print is still too small. Enough to make eyes sore small.Recommend the story and dissapointed at this copy. It's bound more like a workbook or handbook, and is hardly the right book for a coffee table book. Sort of thoughtless choices.

It is filled with drawings, paintings and photographs of life along the Seine River and the history that took place from an anecdotal point of view. The approach that the author took to this book is to allow the reader to understand the stories behind the stones that you see as you walk along the Seine in Paris. Here is an excerpt from the dustjacket: "Behind an old facade they will see the sahadow of a beautiful, plotting woman; in an ancient square they will see traces of riot and massacre; here and there in the street they will see a grandiose gesture, hear a colorful phrase, remember an old tale of love...Paris on the Seine is a promenade along the river past whose shores flows the history of Paris. And Paris is the core of France. Not textbook history, but the tumultuous passionate actions of men and women that raised buildings and brought them down again, spanned the river with bridges, named streets that were then renamed and renamed again..."

This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun.

When he revived he found himself back on earth, separated from Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium and his beloved. Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman. Knowing that it was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel. When Carter returns to Barsoom a decade has passed and he finds himself in that part of the planet that the natives consider to be &quot;heaven,&quot; which proves to be a more ironic idea. Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over. However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh.

I enjoyed reading other works by Bill Bryson, and as someone who has had a chance to drive many parts of back-roads America on business, I had higher hopes for this book, and wanted to enjoy it. But as noted by other reviewers, Bryson comes off in this work as a curmudgeon rather than a humorist. His attitude comes off as that of a "conservative's" pejorative stereotypes of an elitist, stuck-up "liberal" far too good for the likes of Wal-Mart, Gatlinburg, tourist attractions, buses, motels, fast food, and the like. What others may find rural wilderness, he calls "bleak," "depressing," and "lonely." I have been to many of the locales Bryson visited, many at roughly the same time as his 1980s tour (Beaufort, Bloomsburg, Mackinaw City, etc.), and I came away with much different impressions of the same places he describes--most likely because I actually interacted with an area and its occupants as an equal, not passing through hastily as a "foreigner" even though I have a bit of an accent. My cynical impression is that those who find Bryson's travelogue humorous to the point of laugh-out-loud share a similar disdain for "flyover country" and its occupants, whereas those who live, work with, and even enjoy "America's heartland" will find this book disconcerting or depressing at best and insulting or offensive at worst. Worse, the feel of the book is that of someone setting off to tour the country just to write a book about it, not of someone taking a trip to see the country for its own sake.

This is undoubtedly because physics actually IS exciting for Einstein, and this excitement comes through in every page.This book reads as if Einstein thinks of physics as a really good story--complete with all characters and action of any good story--that he really wants to share with his reader.

John Carter the Earth born Virginian blood filled man returns back to Mars to claim what is his. None which means more to him than his beautiful Martian Wife. Not all goes well though as Carter returns to Mars, he finds himself in a part of the planet never seen by his own eyes. As a matter of fact the part of Mars he returns to is in fact what many Martians believe to be Paradise. Their own version of Heaven. All who make the journey to this great beyond do it freely, and are never seen again. Should they return from this paradise they find death waiting to be delt out to them by their own friends and family.John Carter finds this Paradise this Heaven to be a lie. A lie that has seeped into the very fabric of every species of Mars culture, belief, and ideas of life and death. So John Carter does what he does best. He test his metal against even the gods of Mars. He destroys royalty, fortress', and the so called Goddess of Mars herself. Shattering all ideas and beliefs of the Martian man, John Carter turns their Heaven, their believed to be "great afterlife" into a nightmare. John Carter shall open the pits of Hell and make his kingdom out of its fire.Why? For truth, for freedom, for friends, family, and most important Dejah Thoris. Come along on this adventure as Carter finds his son, old allies, and death around every corner at the end of his long sword. None shall cross his path and live. If not by the shear magnificence of John Carters fighing and killing abilites alone then by all the LUCK that one man could ever wish to have. I happen to believe that John Carter must have been born with a horse shoe up his ass for he truely is the luckiest man ever. A fun, and enjoyable read that will pass the time.

Anyone searching for information on recent deaths in Yellowstone will not find anything in this book. With that out of the way, I did find the book interesting although somewhat macabre.''Death in Yellowstone'' contains details on the more than 300 unexpected deaths in the park other than traffic accidents or those of natural causes. Many of the stories are very tragic, but it underscores the fact that visiting a wild, natural area contains some risks. And those risks increase if people do not pause and think about what they are doing.The most engrossing (and most detailed) deaths involve visitors who have fallen into the hot springs and other geothermal pools within Yellowstone. I found these compelling because I could almost put myself in the place of these unfortunate souls who either ventured too close to danger or, in the case of children, wandered into boiling hot pools not realizing how treacherous they are.The rest of the book covers bear attacks, lighting strikes, falls, poisonings from eating plants, burns, and even plane crashes. It may surprise readers that deaths from animal bites or attacks (usually bear or bison) are extremely rare, and drowning deaths are the most common. It's worth noting that most drowning deaths seemed to occur when a sudden storm overturned boats or caused rivers to run swiftly.The author spells out the stories in plain language. There is not much buildup to the event - he often discloses the end result up front then fills-in the story that led to someone's tragic death. While some of the stories (mostly the hot springs and bear attacks) are detailed, in many cases the author is just plucking slim details from newspaper stories published many decades ago. I got little sense of what actually happened and after awhile it was just name after name, death after death.The book is heavily footnoted and thoroughly documented, but there are very few pictures, maps, or charts. I would have also liked to have seen more details about the landscape or geography covered. I've never been to the park and had time visualizing what the scenes looked like. I'll recommend the book but only rate as 3 stars.

The children and their various troubles and mishaps are easy to picture in your mind. While reading this and all of her other books I always feel as though I am there witnessing these events in person!Torey manages to incorporate the heart wrenching story of mother Ladbrooke into the book without taking away from the story of the children. The most beautiful parts of this book occur when Ladbrooke reaches out to Torey for help, in particular a moment that occurs inside a women's bathroom stall after something happens to one of the children.This book has some gut wrenching moments in it but not the nauseatingly horrific images and stories contained in Murphey's Boy and Ghost Girl. This makes it a more easy read than the above mentioned. I would recommend to first time Torey readers that they start with this book or Somebody Else's Kids.

I wanted a good dictionary to help me out, so I purchased the Oxford Dictionary of Statistics. I have found this book to be almost completely worthless for my purposes. The book seems to take a shotgun approach in that it is full of statistical procedures and techniques that (at least in my field) nobody really uses while at the same time not using enough space to explain some important and very standard procedures (such as regression discontinuity). The short story is that it is not very useful at all for anyone working in evaluation of people and/or social programs or any kind of sociological/psychological based field.

Stefanski has recently published several papers on measurement error models with Carroll. Here they have teamed up to write a statistics text on a unique topic. Measurement error models are common and practical when dealing with covariates that have measurement error. Least squares estimation in linear regression is based on the assumption that the predictor variables are measured without error. There are many articles and an excellent text by Fuller "Measurement Error Models", published by Wiley in 1988 that deals with the linear case. Also look at a section in Chapter 5 of Miller's "Beyond ANOVA, Basics of Applied Statistics" that refers to the problem as the error in variables problem. For the nonlinear case this is the first treatment. Well written and well documented, this text provides an up-to-date account of the theory and methods and provides real applications (e.g. the Framingham Heart Study). This is a great reference as are many of the other monographs in this series by Chapman and Hall/CRC Press. Includes bootstrap approaches in the chapter on fitting methods and models.

I've read a few books about safaris, hunting in Africa, etc. (like Peter Capstick), but this is what I always imagined it would really be like. If you've stumbled upon this book (and review) by accident and don't know who Robert Ruark was, you're in for a treat. Ruark was a journalist, author, and big game hunter who wrote from the late 40s until his death in the mid 60s. He was hugely popular during his lifetime, but now has been almost totally forgotten. I stumbled upon one of his books a few years ago (the collection of short stories by McIntosh), and since then I've snarf every Ruark book I could find. This book contains Ruark's own tale of his first safari in Africa in the early 1950s and is an incredibly entertaining and detailed account of safaris. Early on Ruark is keenly concerned about `living up' to the expectations of his PH (Harry Selby) and the retinue of African gun bearers, cooks, skinners, and camp followers. He doesn't want to show any weakness, fear, or inability to hit the target with his gun. As the safari progress and Ruark proves himself a worthy hunting companion, the tale turns into a shared adventure with his PH and other hunting comrades as they stalk a variety of game throughtout East Africa. It is clear from Ruark's writing that a safari (at least in the 50s) was a physically and emotionally grueling experience. The heat in the day, the cold in the night, the swamps, the river crossings, the bugs, the snakes, the waiting, the hours of stalking over rough terrain, the long rides in the Land Rover all for a few minutes of excitement (and occasionally sheer terror). The style of this book is very conversational, Ruark discusses the regular comings and goings of the safari, but he talks about a wide range of other topics including his experiences in WWII in the merchant marine, Hollywood safari movies, the habits of various game animals in Africa, a bit about the diverse natives, and a host of other topics. It really is as if you are sitting with Ruark at the end of a hard day hunting enjoying a cocktail around the campfire. If you've read Ruark before, this isn't his best, but still a terrific read, and worth spending a few extra bucks for the hardback. For anyone interested in safari hunting or safari literature, this is a must own/must read.

Owen	72	75	1999-12-28 01:17:53+08	Worth Buying, But Not Worth 5 Stars	The first half of the book is pretty basic info that I did not find as useful as someone might who is new to resistance training. The latter half of the book outlines how to sculpt your body. For each major muscle group the author classifies exercises into three categories depending on what parts of the muscles are being worked. By doing some or all the exercise he suggests, you can sculpt your body. What I find really useful is to know each of the categories so that I can ensure that I am working all parts of my back, for example. Now I can see that there may be times that I was doing two exercises that were working the same areas. When developing my program, I will refer to each category and make sure I have selected exercises that will cover all the categories.The book does have some flaws. The author stresses at the beginning of the book that it is important to know what muscles you are working so that you can focus on them while exercising. But when he illustrates each exercise, he does not tell you which specific muscles you are working. Most other books will list the latin names of the muscles you are working, and some even illustrate the specific muscles, which is quite useful. He suggests a limited number of exercises for each category. Some of the exercises he mentions you can't find in the book (such as &quot;spider curls&quot;). When you look at the illustrated exercises, he does not tell you what category it is working. You have to keep referring back to an earlier page to figure that out. There are so many more exercises you could do for each of the categories but he does not mention them. It would have been nice if he had a chart of exercises that you could do without having to illustrate all of them. The book does not have an index either.Conclusion: I don't think the book warrants the rave reviews it's received on amazon.com and could have been organized better, but half of the book has useful info. When I first started to read it I was going to return it because the first half of the book wasn't telling me anything I didn't know already. The body sculpting section has good info that I will incorporate into my program, so I have decided to keep the book.

Add to this some of the implausible melodrama and coincidences that make up the plot and I almost ended up putting down the book.However I kept reading and in the end I thought it was an excellent story. This is because it illustrated a truth about life that I could empathize with. How a man through pride, anger, stubbornness and alcoholism could end up destroying his relationships with all of the people he is close to and in middle age end up being alienated from everyone who was important to him in his life. Since this story was written there have been millions of guys like Michael Henchard. The details of their lives are different, their endings may have been different. But there is an underlying truth that is the same. That aspect of the story is timeless.

In todays world that is either fighting on the name of religion without any real spiritual quest or qenching it in hedonistic ways, I feel there is a major need to learn about love and cultivate it than never before. Spitituality as I see it is but a question- " we are born without our will and we die against our will. And things in between seem to happen without me having to say anything much. So, what am i doing here?". Well, there is no real answer to this question, but there is a solution, and that is to feel at home here in this world from the day we are sent to this world untill that day we are forced to call it off. And love for ourselves and for this world is what we need to achieve that state of restfulness. All dogmos and ideologies are nothing but theoretical derivations out of the above mentioned axiom, and problems arise as people stick onto the derivations without really understanding the basic problem, that is, " how to love?". All the spiritual texts put great emphasis on love, but, they associate great sins with the failure to achieve love, and so it is looked upon as a virtue of saints and monks that is not a necessity for ordinary people . But as that is the very problem this whole humanity is trying to answer without really understanding it, no one can really feel peaceful and call himself spiritually matured without mastering this art of loving. And to my knowledge, this is the only book that says love is an art that can be mastered by anyone and everyone by cultivating three simple virtues namely patience, perseverence and practice. With all my heart i recommend this book for anyone with real spiritual quest, for anyone who is interested in finding his place in this world. I suggest you read the last chapter in this book titled " The practice of love" before reading the other chapters.

Giorgio Vasari was an Italian Renaissance artist who also wrote about the various artists of his time. A contemporary of Michangelo, Georgi Vasari's book reads like a Who's Who of Renaissance artists. For a book more than four hundred years old, the style is amazingly modern and interesting.Vasari has an artist's eye for critiquing another artist's work. His writing style is not boring, whereas many would be reduced to general descriptions like "beautiful" and "amateurish", he dissects the artist's work between strong and weak points, pigments and flesh tones or landscapes vs. portraits or the use of light and perspective. He states the reason why some art or one artist is renowned and others ignored. His judgments have generally stood the test of time. Vasari also weaves in some interesting tidbits and anecdotes of the Artist's life. I found this book more interesting than many modern day Art History books.

I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare "sacrilegious magic" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide "Chabad houses" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements.

Highly recommend the book. Movie is only tip of the iceberg. Authors later books on UFO's has more details of his experiences that shaped his understanding of the reality. Easy to read, absorb and understand the much touted complex subject of UFO's. Author pretty much concludes that hyper dimensional denizens with time travel capabilities uses different spectrum of frequencies to create the distraction and harm the curious.

For some time, we've had some flash cards and a small book containing signs to teach our son, who is nearly 1 1/2. I found the little book and cards to be frustrating for multiple reasons. The flash cards get out of alphabetical order easily, so it's hard to look something up; and there are only about 50-60 signs featured in each set. Words that my son would really like to be able to express, like "light" and "fan" and "otter" and "frog," are missing. Additionally, some of the words from the book and flash cards overlap, but the two formats disagree about what the signs are!So, based on the reviews and on the number of signs included, I couldn't wait to get the Random House Webster's Concise American Sign Language Dictionary. The book does have a lot going for it. If you know the alphabet in sign language (and it's included in the book, in case you don't), the descriptions of signs really help clarify the illustrations. As soon as we got the book, I looked up "light" and "frog," and I was delighted to be able to sign them to my son. Catching my excitement, he signed "light" back right away. But "otter" was missing from the dictionary. "Well," I thought, "maybe there is no sign for 'otter.'" No huge loss, since my son does an endearing otter impression anyway.But then I discovered that "fan" has also been left out of the dictionary. "Fan" is a pretty basic and common word, so I assume that there is a specific sign for it.Examples of words that ARE included: ascend, delegate, optimistic, sightseeing, humid, dominoes, rehabilitation, sterilization, robot, sacrifice, slavery, porpoise, hawk, pimples, zap, worship, prostitute, puzzle, diamond, lesbian, loiter, merchandise.Examples of words that AREN'T included: otter, squash, fan, beaver, whale, moose, ceiling, kaleidoscope, owl, crow, robin, quail, raven, tiger, zebra, wolf, coyote, tractor, mow, guava, tortilla, quesadilla, spinach, wheel, cactus, cardinal.Being able to say words like "rehabilitation" is definitely useful; it would take a long time to spell them out. But I think I probably talk about fans more often than I talk about robots. This is a self-proclaimed concise dictionary, and there is a note at the beginning of the book about which words were included and which words weren't (and why), but that still doesn't help me sign "squash" or "moose."I don't know that anyone cares, but the copy of this book that we received does have a slightly different cover than the one pictured. The picture shows hands in a single sign, whereas our book features five full-color photos of a woman signing. I actually like the one we got better than the one pictured.Oh, and previous reviews indicate that the alphabet and numbers are listed in the back of the book. Numbers are still at the back of the book, but each letter of the alphabet now appears at the start of the section of words beginning with that letter.Overall, I was torn between giving the book three stars and four. I really like the descriptions of how to do signs, but that only helps when the word I want to sign is in the dictionary.

I'm not sure that's Humphries' fault - or anybody else's for that matter.Humphries is quite obviously a Thompson fan. Mostly he makes a fair fist of remaining objective about Thompson's work, though he does get on the soapbox from time to time to air his own views.The real problem with this book is that there's no real revelation. Some people might be surprised to know that RT is fond of scrabble, cricket and gardening (the anoraks amongst his fans knew all that already), but that's about it really.The real problem - and it's not really the author's fault - is that Thompson, apart from his music, is a very ordinary person. English post-war middle class upbringing, two marriages, one divorce, one religious conversion (which hasn't coloured his work in the long run). Still touring hard in his middle age but there's no sex and drugs, no groupies, just a bit of scrabble at the back of the bus. Where's the best seller in that?So full marks to Humphries for trying and full marks to the very private Thompson for agreeing to go along with it all, but unless you're a Thompson completist save the cash and buy the CDs instead. That is where all the truly remarkable things about Richard Thompson are to be found.

I find it hard to believe that The Black Arrow is probably the least well know of his great adventure novels (the others being, of course, Treasure Island and Kidnapped), as it is certainly the best as far as I am concerned. As far as the story goes, it is one of the most entertaining plots that I have ever encountered. It is filled with more twists and turns than I would have thought possible, but remains very clear and fast paced. The characters are wonderful, as is the description and the writing itself. Granted, some of the language is a bit archaic, but I feel that this adds a lot to the authenticity of the story.The Black Arrow is not a very easy read at first, but once you get into it it really flies by. It is as entertaining, exciting, and intriguing book as you will find, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Taylor	1	3	2012-09-01 07:26:03+08	Speed bumps	There are many great reviews of this book that go into detail on the content, so I'm not going to get into it. I will simply note that the writing style used by this author is not one I enjoy reading. He is a fan of the comma and consistently breaks up his sentences with several of them to accommodate his overuse of parenthetical elements and interrupters. To me, a comma is a speed bump in prose; it indicates a pause. There a lots of speed bumps in nearly every paragraph of this book.A couple of examples: "How can one respect, let alone adopt, the values of a people who do not, on any level whatever, live the way they say they do, or the way they say they should?" and "It happened, as many things do, imperceptibly, in many ways at once. I date it - the slow crumbling of my faith, the pulverization of my fortress - from the time, about a year after I had begun to preach, when I began to read again. I justified this desire by the fact that I was still in school, and I began, fatally, with Dostoyevsky."For some people, this is beautiful prose. For me, I can't take it. I want to dive in and rewrite the entire thing to strip out hundreds of commas and extraneous nonrestrictive modifiers. Perhaps I was a Spartan in a former life.

He likes you the way you are - don't change, unless you've been constantly changing for him, then SLAP yourself and BE yourself and enjoy YOUR life, not the life you hope to bring to him to make him happy and not yourself. Life is SHORT. Why would you want to live any other way? You aren't his call girl and when's the last time YOU had an O? This is YOUR LIFE TOO. And, as Sherry says, he likes you better when he has to chase you. Even the most beautiful girl will lose a guy if she chases him (by doing everything for him). BORING!Of course maintain yourself. But be there for yourself first, and do stuff for yourself first so you don't have to keep expecting him to be everything to you. Let him show you who he is, and see if that's what you need.Sherry's book is awesome because it makes a woman feel GOOD about herself without actually harming a man. She explains things like when you complain on and on, he hears blah blha balsh... and YOU become the PROBLEM that he tries to avoid.This book is great for keeping things fresh in a marriage too. WE so often forget to keep dating our spouses. NOT GOOD! Keep the fire burning. This book is a great little update.And if you DON'T have a guy, quit trying so hard and go do things that you enjoy... and who knows... since you'll be enjoying yourself anyways, who cares if there is or isn't a cute eligible man at your next destination... you're having fun anyways! And a happy gal, is a sexy gal!Be good to yourself and the rest will follow.I've recommended and purchased this book for several friends. It is funny too!

Although the book is well written and presents the material in easy to understand way, I have an objection to the Author's bias against other programming languages. The author does not mention Java's 'weakness'. Of course that is difficult burden for the author since he is a Sun employee I suppose, but books specially technical books should be written as intellectually honest as possible. It shouldn't be an opportunity for marketing Java. I think Eckle's Thinking in Java is a great book covering both the strong and weak sides of Java in a neutral way.Also another comment, you better know other programming language before you buy this book. Other than that it is a great book and I like the Author's sense of humor. Gives great examples also.

I also have a number of questions that i will ahve to research. these should have been covered in the book!!some words are thrown out to show his music experience as they have little relevance to the topic at hand. maybe you know what a dobro is ,but most of us dont -- and we have no need to know it either (but appears to be some sort of specialised percussive instrument. and hints on recording ti are not appropriate in this book.this book is copyright 2009 which is why i bought itelse i would suggest looking atjeffs pc recording studio for dummys insteadbut that one is sadly out of dateand may well suffer from the same editing/production problems as thsi onebut i have only glanced at the TOC and copyright date so farthis one covers too much non pc recording options (stand alone disk and all_in_one non_PC related hardware devices) which is a total waste these days, but could possibly be justified in this book but not the pc recording studio book done in 2004 (copyright 2005) which needs to be updated real soon now or any book that covers PC music which is the only viable alternative circa 2009. such Stand alone options are only marginally cheaper and are much harder to use and inflexible.it covers too much miking of drums (author used to be a drummer!) and is way too light on explaining PC interface devices.he should cover more about sound cards and how they fit in the big picture and less on making your own sound panels. i am interested in PC music not carpentry.there are probably better books out there(it is hard to imagine worse but i have seen some! so caveat emptor)but i have not looked for better intros yeti grabbed this one at the local borders on impulse because i was thereand wanted to read something on this topic right away. this was the least worst of their paltry selection. and to be fair, i learned some thigns, and relearned some things i had not used for years. but it did not live up to what i expected in such a book.search amazon for PC music not home recording and you will likely come up with more appropriate books.

I have since gotten my hands on as much of these books that pertain to my family and children as I can!! Jim Fay has really got some great ideas. And they work!! Even if you're not really "In Crisis" with your family or a specific member, this is good to get to 'be prepared'. And maybe if more parents used these ways early on then they would never get to the 'in crisis' stage - wouldn't that be great??!! The idea of this philosophy is to NOT make the parent the Bad Guy for punishing the kid. It puts it back on the kid - WHERE IT BELONGS!! They also have classes on this that you can take at schools taught by other parents and there are seminars by the authors of these books too.

This is one of a set of books geared toward educating the person, the counselor, as well as the general public in the harms caused by sexual abuse, but it also highlights the resilency of the person who has gone through it.

If you are a stock market investor, than this book must appear as one of your top 10 books to read. Investors really have no choice but to read this book because unlike any book you will ever read, this book teaches you about the CROWD. What motivates the crowd, and what causes people to join the crowd. If you were to ask any of the famous investors you have read about, every one of them is aware of the importance of CROWD PSYCHOLOGY. Warren Buffett has always talked about Mr. Market, which he learned from Benjamin Graham.Now having said this let me tell you quickly what this book is about. MacKay in a brilliant, and in an interesting manner takes you through 700 pages of mass buying panics from centuries ago. These include The Witch Mania (100 pages) in the 15th and 16th century. The Crusades (100 pages), Alchemy (160 pages), and the Poisoners- hey, poisoning people was a big thing centuries ago- remember Napoleon.The big buying binge that most people recognize is the South Sea Tulip Craze, where the participants bid up the price of tulips, yes tulips to the equivalent cost of houses and more. We're not done, MacKay goes through many, many more crazes, panics, and buying binges. All of these stories involve the CROWD. Extraordinary Popular Delusions... has survived the test of time. We do not know if anything being written today, or any studies being researched currently will be able to stand the time test? We only know that MacKay's book has.Is the book interesting?Yes it's fascinating, but you have to be interested in this subject. If you are in the financial markets you have no to STUDY, NOT READ this book. I say this because I have been a money manager and history buff for 35 years. If I did not live through the modern equivalent of MacKay's book, frankly I wouldn't believe half the stuff that is in this book, which is presented as truth.The reality is I have seen MacKay's explanations work out in my own lifetime, and so have you. A few 20th century equivalents are in order:1) INTERNET STOCK MAREKT CRAZE: 1999 - 2000Wow, I did an analysis of the market value, of a major Internet stock in play at the time of the craze. The stock was representative of hundreds of other companies participating in the run-up in value. One day, I discovered that this Internet stock's market value was the equivalent of ten major corporations combined. These companies included IBM, GM, Ford, Chrysler, Electronic Data Processing, JC Penny, Sears, and others, all combined. It couldn't be. Did I calculate wrong? It was true, and the number was getting bigger every day.Over $1.4 trillion dollars had been committed to Internet stocks by some of the smartest savviest people in the world. When it was over, that $1.4 trillion was reduced to under $100 billion. Over 90 plus percent of the value had simply disappeared. This was Extraordinary Popular Delusions all over again, and you lived through it too.2) Personal Note: During the Internet Craze, I was re-tooling by taking courses at Harvard University. Every five years, I try to do this. I would drive up once a week and spend eight hours in financial classes with some of America's truly outstanding teaching professors to see what's new in academia that hasn't hit the money management industry yet. These world-renowned professors all got swept into the Internet stock market craze. They personally lost substantial pieces of their net worth. Every one of them was claiming that we were in a new age. They were throwing out their financial training out the window.These were Professors who had read every page of MacKay's book, underlined it, annotated it, and even memorized sections. This is what you need to know. The first words that come out of a person's mouth involved in mass hysteria are - THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. It's a dead giveaway that we are in a POPULAR DELUSION.3) The American Invasion of Iraq: Forget whether the President was right or wrong. Every intelligence agency in the world believed that the Iraqi's had weapons of mass destruction. David Kay, perhaps the smartest man in government believed it. This again, is an example of the crowd psychology in action.4) Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba- President Kennedy as smart a man as they come got swept up into the crowd psychology believing along with everyone else that 1500 poorly trained Cubans could land on a beach in Cuba, and then suddenly without support, walk their way into Havana picking up ordinary people on the countryside who would swell their ranks and allow these expatriates to overthrow the Castro regime. These were the smartest men in government that believed this.The list goes on and on, and if you the reader live long enough, you will see yourself swept up in these instances of mass hysteria. If two Presidents of the United States can get caught up in crowd psychology, we all better be on the lookout for it. Good luck.Richard Stoyeck

It deals mainly with Germans and their Romanian, Hungarian, Croatian and Italian comrades. But unlike Beevor it covers all three armed forces: airforce army and navy. As such it is actually a very rare book. Its conclusion that the Luftwaffe were at least equal partners in all German operations, and sometimes even the dominant service, is hard to refute. The story is engaging and the writing excellent. Maps and photos are helpful and the index is more than adequate. All things said, therefore, this is an excellent book.

The first chapter of the book was amazing and that chapter, for me, alone made the book worth the time. In this one chapter he was able to formalize a lot of ideas that had been swirling around in my head from the other books I have been reading. It was a great chapter dealing with US concepts of what Muslims are and how those concepts influence our actions but are really based on a flawed and one-sided perspective. A "good" Muslim is considered someone who supports US actions even though those very same actions could be detrimental for the "good" Muslim, while the "bad" Muslim is the one who defies the US. The problem with the concept of the "bad" Muslim is that it lumps all Muslims who disagree with US policy into one group, but the fact is that some of these people are not terrorists hell bent on destroying us but instead are people who have legitimate grievances with US policy. The first chapter was excellent.After the first chapter, though, the author flies off topic and never returns. Instead of following the first chapter's theme and the tile's theme the author spends the rest of the book critiquing US foreign policy of the last forty years. While a lot of the author's critique is legitimate and well detailed, it has nothing to do with the title of the book. The author doesn't even focus any of the remaining book on Muslims or Islam but instead focuses on US policy and only writes of Muslims in an ancillary way. Muslims and Islam is put on the periphery. This would be fine if the title of the book was "US Foreign Policy" but it isn't.The reason why I still give the book a good rating is that the information is good. This book is the first I have read that focuses on the CIA and US interventionist policies and carries that focus to its contemporary conclusion in this way. It's linear which gives the reader a clear picture of where we were and how we got here.At the same time the author treats US policy as if it operates in a vacuum and is not affected by other factors domestic and foreign. Of course it is difficult to take that broad of a picture and condense it into three hundred pages, but I still see this as a flaw.All in all I do recommend this book. A lot of the material will be rehash for those well versed in the history of US foreign policy, but the way the author connects the dots I found to be worth the effort. Also the copy I read the notes were not numbered or identified in any way in the text, so the note section was completely worthless for me. I am assuming this was a mistake in my copy and not something that every other copy had as well.

It gets you thinking for yourself about the movements of stocks. There is no way one can absorb all the information provided within the text. It is a guide and reference for those who want to devote time to stock analysis. I am now more educated on stock trends, but still require the book for periodic refreshers. If you're buying this book for casual reading, find another book. Although very good, this book is very intense and reading it will consume some time. Dedication is required to finish the book, but the potential for success is great, much greater than a lottery ticket.

"If she didn't exist we would have to make her." Yes this plot is tenuous and mystic and intends to be deep. We follow the story of college student Sophie, who is doing a term paper on the Promethea character, who reemerges in literature, pulp fiction and comics. Strangely many of the people involved in creating the art that shows Promethea also claimed to have met her. Sophie soon finds an idea that can enter our world (or at least her world - a very technologically advanced 1999 in which cars fly through a world of neon billboards).The plot and story here were surprisingly coherent. First of course Sophie meets Promethea and begins to understand how an idea can enter the realworld and become physically real. Interspersed are back stories on how Promethea originally came to be and on the artists she has touched in past manifestations.The graphics: The artistic style is the normal comic booky style done very well. However the layouts are spectacular. Often there is a border surrounding the frames on a spread - and in that border part of the scene is taking place. Almost any spread of two pages hangs together as one coherent whole. Anyone interested in graphic design and comics should check this one out.Overall Promethea was a good comic book. The graphics were spectacular. Even though the plot is a bit artsy and pretentious, by about half way through I was hooked. There is enough action and "good parts" to keep things flowing well.

I was almost tempted to tell the clerk at the store as she was ringing up the trade that I had changed my mind on buying it, thinking it might be a waste of $20. I sat down for a couple hours and read it front ot back, which is something I usually don't do for something 12 (comic) issues in length, and I found this instantly became my definitive origin for the Man of Steel, despite my love for Jeph Loeb's interpretation in his "Superman: For All Seasons." He wasn't instantly accepted by society as a savior, instead having to prove himself the hard way, against the machinations of a (for once) truly menacing Lex Luthor. This was the first trade in a while that I felt compelled to pick up again to flip through on the same day I read it. I'm generally a Marvel fan, but in these handful of instances such as with "Birthright" and "Batman: Year One" where DC publishes a gem that shines above the rest, at least within my opinion.

I almost rate this as a "guilty pleasure" because some of the book is, naturally, gossipy, but it is a pleasure not to be missed by SNL fans. It's interesting to see the changes in the show over the years, from the drug-fueled early days of edgy, almost anarchic humor through the times when the show almost got the axe after severe dips in quality and popularity, to it's almost iconic status today. There's a lot more to this book than the overly-publicized "everyone hates Chevy" aspect. It's a big book, but hard to put down. Definitely worth a read by SNL fans, especially those who have been fans from the beginning.

Having read a number of books on publishing in the past several months, I was delighted to stumble upon "Getting It Published." Although it isn't directly related to my current career path - presently, I'm self-publishing a general trade nonfiction book, as opposed to a scholarly tome - I found Germano's advice to be helpful, thoughtful, and eloquent nonetheless.In welcome contrast to the many publishing books that are aimed at more general audiences, "Getting It Published" does not dumb itself down for the lowest common denominator. Germano's writing is witty, enjoyable, and informed - it's as though you're receiving guidance from your academic advisor rather than reading a how-to book written by some faceless, self-proclaimed publishing "guru." It should come as no surprise that Germano is the VP and publishing director at Routledge. His wealth of insight is remarkable - he covers the process of publishing scholarly work from beginning to end. From writing the manuscript, to crafting a successful proposal, signing a contract, and seeing the work through to publication, Germano doesn't miss a beat. He even covers the not-so-little details, like copyrights, permissions, quotations, artwork, and cover design. His discussion of the various publishing houses and their tasks ("What do publishers do?") was most informative."Getting It Published" is a must-have for those new to scholarly publishing. Newbies to the world of publishing who aren't looking to publish scholarly work won't be disappointed, either - there's plenty of useful information in here for everyone. It also serves as a much-needed break from all those awful "For Dummies" books and "Idiot's Guides" that seem to saturate the publishing market!

The authors define it as "A comprehensive and flexible system for achieving, sustaining and maximizing business success. Six Sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of customer needs, disciplined use of facts, data, and statistical analysis, and diligent attention to managing, improving, and reinventing business processes."This work is made up of three major sections. The first part provides an executive summary of this system. The second part focuses on the organizational aspects of adopting this system. The last part, focuses on the actual implementation of Six Sigma including the roadmap and tools. Also included in this book, are numerous appendices that provide further "practical support".What sets this book apart is both the breadth and depth in which the topic is discussed. Whether one is a novice or expert, looking to obtain a high level overview or a deep understanding of the subject matter, this book is for you. In addition, the interspersed case studies, examples and tools make it very practical and applicable. After reading this book - one cannot but concur with the authors' closing remark: "We believe - and hope you agree - that there are enough essential, powerful, and valuable elements to make the Six Sigma system, in some way, part of every successful business. At the same time, we strongly encourage you to adapt the discipline and methods of Six Sigma to best impact your unique culture, industry, market position, people, and strategy. Our biggest fear is that people will "accept" or "reject" Six Sigma as it it were a thing (falling victim to the Tyranny of the Or) and not use it as a flexible system."Below are key excerpts from the book, that I found particularly insightful:1) "The Benefits of Six Sigma: 1) Generates sustained success...2) Sets a performance goal for everyone...3) Enhances value to customers...4) Accelerates the rate of improvement...5) Promotes learning and "cross pollination"...6) Executes strategic change"2) "Six Themes of Six Sigma: 1) Genuine Focus on the Customer...2) Data- and Fact-Driven Management...3) Process focus, Management, and Improvement...4) Proactive Management...5) Boundaryless Collaboration...6) Drive for Perfection; Tolerance for Failure"3) "Six Sigma Improvement and Management Strategies: 1) Process Improvement: Finding Targeted Solutions...2) Process Design/Redesign: Building a Better Business...3) Process Management: The Infrastructure for Six Sigma Leadership"4) "In the Six Sigma Way, we will use and refer to a five-phase improvement cycle that has become increasingly common in Six Sigma organizations: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control - or DMAIC."5) "...The ideal roadmap for establishing the Six Sigma system and launching improvements...1) Identify core processes and key customers. 2) Define customer requirements. 3) Measure current performance. 4) Prioritize, analyze, and implement improvements. 5) Expand and integrate the Six Sigma system."6) "Five-step measurement implementation model: 1) Select what to measure 2) Develop operational definitions 3) Identify data sources 4) Prepare collection & sampling plan 5) Implement and refine measurement"7) "We can offer an assessment model, however, based on two major conditions - both of which must be met if process design/redesign is going to work: 1) A major need, threat, or opportunity exists: a) Shifts in customer needs/requirements...b) Demand for greater flexibility...c) New technologies...d) New or changed rules and regulations...e) Competitors are changing...f) Old assumptions (or paradigms) are invalid...g) The current process is "a mess"...2) You're ready and willing to take on the risk: a) Longer lead-time for change is acceptable...b) Resources and talent are available...c) Leaders, and the organization as a whole, will support the effort...d) The "Risk Profile" is acceptable."8) "Process Value Analysis: As processes get more complex, they tend to insulate people from the real reason that customers patronize a business. "Value Analysis" is a way of reemphasizing the key raison d'etre of a business or process by looking at work from the external customer's point of view. In the analysis, we assign each process step to one of three categories: 1) Value Adding...2) Value Enabling...3) Non-Value-Adding"9) "Twelve Keys To Success: 1) The Six Sigma Efforts to Business Strategy and Priorities 2) Position Six Sigma as an Improved Way to Manage for Today 3) Keep the Message Simple and Clear 4) Develop Your Own Path to Six Sigma 5) Focus on Short-Term Results 6) Focus on Long-Term Growth and Development 7) Publicize Results, Admit Setbacks, and Learn from Both 8) Make and Investment to Make It Happen 9) Use Six Sigma Tools Wisely 10) Link Customers, Process, Data, and Innovation to Build the Six Sigma System 11) Make Top Leaders Responsible and Accountable 12) Make Learning an Ongoing Activity"

She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony. If you are that clueless to these types people using you, you need a check up from the neck up. If you want a real story; read Richard Dry's book called Leaving for a true African-American story.

Since Italian is a big part of Bryanna's heritage, as she details in this cookbook, she seems to handle each recipe with care and very detailed explanations for those of us who may not be intimately familiar with the makings of each dish.Those who are vegan or simply egg-free will love her guide and recipes for making fresh pasta (yes, I said fresh egg-free pasta!); those who crave the rich flavors of cheese will delight in the alternative recipes for mascarpone, Parmesan, and ricotta (Bryanna typically provides soy-free, nut-free, and at times gluten-free options for staple recipes such as these); and those like myself will be drawn in by the many comfort food recipes. The countless recipes for cream sauces, risottos, potato dumplings, stuffed pastas, rich casseroles, pastry cr&egrave;mes (5 recipes for different pastry cr&egrave;mes alone), and tarts are enough to make me want to hibernate in my kitchen for the winter!Beyond dairy alternative, vegans will also like the many traditionally meat-filled Italian dishes that Bryanna takes on. Though my family is still omnivorous, I must admit that veal cutlets and Italian meatballs are no match for her animal-free creativity.Of note, Bryanna writes very detailed instructions, often with many alternative options. This can be a very good thing, but, like many traditional Italian recipes, some of the recipes can be involved, best for a leisurely Sunday afternoon. This by no means covers all of the recipes though. Most of the sauces can be whipped up in minutes, and there is a plethora of pasta, hearty soup, and vegetable dishes that could actually be considered quick and easy. Among these, I was particularly taken by the creamy Bechamel sauce and the Pasta with Spicy Eggplant. Plus many of the recipes, like the potato dumplings (I am dying to try the pumpkin version!) become quite quick to make once you get the hang of it.If I were to suggest any change for this cookbook, it would be simply be a minor layout issue. Though not a deal breaker by any means, I often mess up recipes when they are in a "run on" format. That is, one recipe may start in the middle of a page, run on to the next page, and immediately be followed by the next recipe, and so on. It could just be my poor eyesight, but I find myself accidentally reading from the wrong recipe when they are in this free flowing format. However, I must give kudos for the well-sized print and the notes for calories, fat, and carbohydrates on each recipe, which many people may find useful.And just in case you were wondering, there are recipes for pizza, calzones, and tiramisu!

Pellitteri	5	7	2009-11-19 01:34:45+08	Puzzle solved	I have always wondered the psychological reasons why different political views see the same situation so differently yet each so consistently. Why do liberals most often attack conservatives as stupid or mean? Why do conservatives fight less ardently for their political goals? This book explains from several different angles the two main strains of thought that make up the modern political struggle. Are the solutions to all our problems just to revise our system of government and put the smartest people in power? This is essentially the "liberal"( under the current definition) view. The other side feels that there are no select few people that know best how to run things and that life is a series of trade-offs. The solution is to work a trade-off that best solves the situation. After reading this book the debate makes so much sense. I now know why the liberals think that 600 or so lawyers in Washington should be trusted more that every other American making their own decisions. Just yesterday a government panel was telling us that mammograms before 50 and every year are a waste of money. You see if you crunch the numbers, it's cheaper to treat a few more patients that weren't caught early than to spend on all these extra tests that find nothing. The everyday common person is going to want to over-test to be sure. How stupid! The 600 lawyers came up with the idea of borrowing $4,500 from the Chinese to give to car buyers, if they would buy a new car and completely destroy their old car. Destroy it so that the parts could not even be used. Doesn't a new car have to be created to replace that car? Doesn't it use energy to create that new car?I'm convinced that Thomas Sowell is one of the few smart people that could run this country, but he's smart enough to know it is not the answer.

To point a finger so directly at one side and ask it to make all of the concessions is impractical and foolish. His passionate pleas for the US State Department to admit guilt and claim responsibility is an interesting but imbecilic and impotent gesture. The Middle East seems to live in a shame / honor value system and has been attacked because it listens to its weaker conscience in the face of adversity. By nature of Osama's claims that he attacked us because he saw us as weak seems to demand that we take none of the prescriptions Mamdani calls for. I cannot despute his discussions of the proxy wars but knowing a few people who were there and especially knowing intimately what Magnus Malan contributed to Southern African stability I know that Mamdani represents a very communistic / leftist crowd. Good reading, worth looking at from an alternative standpoint to Bernard Lewis, Hutchinson,Pryce-Jones et al. It is a dead give away though when Noam Chomsky is featured as a praiser of some work. A real lightening rod and not one to really contribute to a healthy dialog about the Middle East.

Arguably, the theories under discussion in this volume are outside the realm of science since they are at present, as they are likely to be into the far distant future, empirically unverifiable. Even so, as Kaku argues, science may yet uncover indirect evidence of wormholes, dimensions 5-10, and strings. Whether or not this proves true, one cannot help but be awed and delighted by the mere possibility that the universe -- fascinating already in its meager 4 dimensions -- is structured and functions in the ways MK describes. To see the mathematics of higher dimensions so neatly subsuming the laws of physics as we know them (electromagnetism, relativity, etc.), one cannot help but imagine that a beautiful and simple unified theory might indeed lie just round the bend. Hyperspace thrills with the excitement of that possibility. It is a terrific read.

Even though it's very short, Moore packs insightful and relevant concepts into just a few pages that made my head spin after reading them. It is obvious that he puts a lot of effort and care into his writing, and he considers every detail: from character development to panel transitions to writing for a specific market and beyond. All these topics are covered here in-depth in a surprisingly succinct and conscientious manner for someone who is notorious for producing scripts that contain hundreds of pages. I particularly enjoyed Moore's analogies about lulling the reader into a semi-cognitive state where they are completely entranced by the story, and then using the crux or the climax to shock them so violently and thoroughly in this dream state that once they snap out of it they will never forget what happened to them. When he wrote this treatise on the writing of comics Alan Moore was still relatively young, but already a master of pace and plotting as well as where to mine for the central 'idea' behind every story which is the most vital part of the creative process. He uses several issues of Swamp Thing which he was writing at the time (circa 1985 or so) to substantiate his claims, and it is here where one truly comes to appreciate his brilliance. More than anybody except maybe Will Eisner, Moore is the foremost authority on comics scriptwriting, and this book helped me to understand and appreciate the comics that I have been reading for the last 25 years so much more. A worthy read for anyone interested in the creative process behind the pages and panels of comics.

As a result, Kaku explores the world of geometry and space-time--that is, he explores the invisible universe.This book makes accessible to the general but intelligent reader the fascinating research on hyperspace theory.Scientifically, the hyperspace theory goes by other names such as Kaluza-Klein theory and supergravity. But in its most advanced form, it's called superstring theory. This theory predicts the precise number of dimensions: ten.This book, which has a main narrative of about 330 pages, is divided into four parts:Part one (four chapters) develops the early history of hyperspace (which began in the mid-1800s), emphasizing the theme that the laws of nature become simpler when expressed in higher dimensions. For example, in space-time, the laws of gravity and electromagnetic radiation (such as light) each obey a different physics and a different mathematics. However, if a fifth dimension is added to the space-time continuum, then the equations "governing light and gravity appear to merge together like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle."The main conclusion of this part is that space-time is inadequate or "too small" to describe the forces that shape our universe. When expressed in higher dimensions, however, there is "enough room" to explain these forces.The second part (five chapters) elaborates on part one's conclusion emphasizing that the hyperspace theory may be able to unify the four fundamental physical forces of nature (as well as their collection of subatomic particles) into one major theory (the so-called "Theory of Everything"), a unification that Einstein was unable to achieve.Hyperspace theory suggests the possibility that everything we see around us (such as trees, mountains, and stars) is nothing but vibrations. "If this is true, then this gives us an elegant, simple, and geometric means of providing a coherent and compelling description of the entire universe."Part three (three chapters) explores the possibility that, under extreme circumstances, space may be stretched until it rips and tears. From this, we get the concept of "wormholes" or tunnels that link distant parts of space and time. Thus, time travel via time machines that exploit these tunnels may be possible.Cosmologists have proposed the possibility that our universe is only one among an infinite number of parallel universes. By analyzing Einstein's equations, they have shown that there might exist a web of wormholes that connect these universes.Although theoretical, hyperspace travel may eventually provide the most practical application of all: to save intelligent life, including ours, from the death of the universe by collapse. In the last seconds of our universe's death, intelligent life may escape this collapse by going into hyperspace.The last part (three chapters) concludes with a final, practical question: If hyperspace theory is proven to be correct, then when will we be able to harness its power? Answer: when our civilization develops the technical capability that enables us to harness the immense energy required for manipulating space-time or hope for contact with an advanced technical civilization that has already mastered hyperspace. (Included in this book is a good discussion on extraterrestrial civilizations.)In the meantime, we can calculate the precise energy needed to create a "time-warp" (where space and time are twisted into a "pretzel") or to create wormholes that link distant parts of our universe. This book ends by speculating on the level of technology that's needed for us to perform these feats, a technology that will make us "masters of hyperspace."This is a history book, a storybook (that contains both true and hypothetical stories), a physics book, a mathematics book, and a book of scientific speculation. All physics and mathematics is explained by analogy and with good diagrams. This book as a whole is enjoyable to read but I found it necessary to slow down sometimes to grasp some major concepts.The only prerequisite needed to read this book, in my opinion, is the ability to visualize and to have an appreciation for the power of physics and mathematics.Finally, I recognize that some theories presented in this book have advanced since its 1994 publication but I feel that this book is an excellent starting point to become familiar with key concepts that are needed to understand more advanced topics.In conclusion, Kaku's final words in the book are as follows: "Some people seek meaning in life through personal gain, through personal relationships, or through personal experiences. However, it seems to me that being blessed with the intellect to [understand] the ultimate secrets of nature gives meaning in life." This book exposes some of those "secrets of nature" and makes them understandable. Thus I urge you to go beyond space-time and experience the hyperspace odyssey.+++++

The reappearance of characters from earlier in the series was a nice surprise, especially when one has been rejuvenated younger than his grandchild. It was a humorous touch, and the first half of this book seemed to recapture a part of the lightness that made the first several books such pleasant reads. I initially really liked Breanna's spirit and how she faced her prejudices, but her outspoken and militant pro-zombie tone was a turn off. The "zombies are people, too" message was handled much better, IMO, in "Dragon on a Pedestal," when Irene comes to appreciate Zora Zombie.No Xanth novel would be complete without at least one region of bad puns, nor at least one beautiful woman using her assets to manipulate men. In this case, the victims are married and subjected to kisses and tantalizing contact with provocative portions of distaff flesh. The men even do some kissing themselves. Light sexuality has always been part of this series, but in some of these last several books, what used to come across as just fun seems to have taken a naughty turn. The married men resist temptation, to their credit, but the author seems to be toying a bit close to the borders of adultery. In spite of all this, the story was still enjoyable and a quick read.The ending hints at significant developments in the novels ahead, so it's on to the next one. . .

As Dante did for Italian, Chaucer did for English - making the English vernacular an accepted language to write literature with, standardizing usages by inspiring imitation, and making up or adopting literally hundreds upon hundreds of words into the language. Chaucer is where old English ends and Middle English begins.This translated version is okay if you just want to get the story out of the tales, but if you find you like Chaucer even the smallest bit I would strongly urge you to try reading the original Middle English. It honestly is not all that hard if you give it any effort at all and you will be richly rewarded - Chaucer's poetry is simply breathtaking. This translation is decent, but know that you are missing half the show.

In prose free of academic rhetoric, the authors state: &quot;[I]f your school is inflicting a mediocre education on your child, the sooner you know about it the better.&quot; They then present a &quot;yardstick&quot; by which to judge the academic quality of any school (public or private). A model core curriculum organized by grade level--primary (K-3), intermediate (4-6), and junior high (7 and 8)--presents the material clearly and logically, and helps readers assess whether a child is getting a thorough dose of English, history and geography, the arts, math and science. While blunt in their criticism of decaying academic standards (evident in grade inflation, lowered expectations for students and terrible international rankings), the authors are unequivocal in their support of dedicated educators and all those willing to hold children to the highest possible standard. Parents may question some of the model curriculum's expectations (e.g., that second graders dramatize the death of Socrates), but the authors are quick to reassure readers that the book's purpose is not to serve as a list of must-haves but rather as &quot;inspiration and general guidance&quot; in gaining a sense of &quot;the knowledge and skills that should lie at the heart of a solid elementary education.&quot; Bennett is a controversial figure because of his passionate cultural conservatism. But this book, despite a brief word in favor of school vouchers, is about padagogy, not politics. It's an ambitious and commonsensical guide that will inspire both parents and educators. 100,000 first printing; 25-city radio satellite tour. (Nov.) Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.

This book helped me to understand that women in the sex industry are stereotyped and that customers of these industries are too, while it attempted to explain the paradox of the &quot;feminist sex worker.&quot; Overall, it had great insight to the industry intermixed with feminist theory to explain or analyze the sex business.

The lecture and the book were mesmerising. The book is worth reading again and again. I just finished reading it a few weeks ago and thought it worthwhile to make a brief comment.Kaku diligently takes the layman through the odyssey of time and space and explains complicated theories in simple terms. Did you know that all of us have heard about the theory of Hyperspace? Read Alice in Wonderland, read Hyperspace, and then read Alice in Wonderland again.The concept of multi-dimensions to a 3D audience has been simply explained by Kaku and, like Richard Dawkins, makes the reader feel intelligent! What used to belong in the realm of science fiction is now being accepted as a plausible theory on the evolution and end of our universe. It is a shame that we won't live long enough to see if Superstring/Hyperspace theories are proven to be true or not!I do like Kaku's debate into various philosophers and their ideas about the universe and their concepts of God. I also liked his slight digression into the classifications of possible intergalactic civilisations into 3 types depending on the advancement of technologies and management of their solar resources. These are worthwhile digressions which support the main body of the book, which is a multidimensional universe.If you are a Star Trek fan or interested in Astronomy or you are just plain interested in our universe, this book is for you. I can't wait to get hold of Kaku's newer books!

I wrote this little tome when I was a mere 20 years old, fresh out of language school and headed to war in Iraq. Not a defense of the text's weaknesses, surely; however, it is food for my own reflection of the experience of writing this book.The text's organization is its most glaring weakness (in my humble opinion). With only three months to write and edit the whole piece, I must have traversed several dozen major revisions of the structure of the text. With each revision, I tried to preserve the most essential elements of the language even as I had to amputate core grammatical and philosophical concepts.It was an imperfect and rushed process with no opportunity to return for substantive edits later.As a young writer, when faced with even the most inauspicious opportunity to write an Idiot's Guide edition, the cost of sacrificing all ownership rights to the penned work seems so much lower than the potential reward. The real cost becomes manifest within a few years or more. While Wikimedia entries can live and breathe in real time, humble CIG tomes are cast once and left forever to occupy a static space.The Russian language evolves constantly, but it is sadly not possible to capture any of its mutations in the scope of my humble text. I can only say that I gave this book my all while I had the chance, and if I had been (legally) able to contribute more to it in the last 10 years, I would have.If ever any dear reader wants to pursue the Russian language further with me directly, please have at me!

It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.

That said, it wasn't the worst book I have read, but it certainly is the worst I have read recently. Since this is my first go at reading Higgins I will assume perhaps he is an acquired taste that I just haven't acquired as of yet.My suspension of disbelief was stretched to the limit and beyond by such gems as (***** Spoilers follow *****)* The president of the United States only has 2 secret service men every weekend, and one of those is a communications guy.* A billionaire hires an assassin apparently incapable of accomplishing the simplest of tasks. Why didn't he use a law rocket instead of a sniper rifle? Don't you think a billionaire could hire several competent assassins?* Why could Dillon just go round and shoot the bad guys sometimes but other times he needed proof.* Continually the bad guy keeps trying to kill Dillon at every opportunity "because he is not expecting it right now". Well golly gee, I guess maybe Dillon would never have caught on to that the first dozen or so times Rashid tried to have him offed.I sort of liked Sean Dillon but at times the novel seemed almost a self-parody. The number of times the characters threatened to do one another in face to face was ludicrous. Really, why not just pull out the guns and have at it right there.Now I am going to go drink a Bushmills. The worst part is I might actually buy the follow-up book to this one because I developed a modicum of curiosity as to the future these characters. So it wasn't a total loss. But after reading some espionage thrillers by Daniel Silva I was quite disappointed in this Higgins offering.

As a starting point, Mr Billinghurt's book is poorly edited. It is full of spelling mistakes, and has no index.The information contained with it, is duplicated several times through the book, making it at least 60% longer than what it should be.Probably the worst thing about the book is Mr Billinghurst has wrongly classifed dogs as omnivores, when indeed, dogs are carnivores. His approach to feeding, consequently, is fundamentally flawed. In this book he promotes feeding grains, fruits, brewer's yeast, and vegetables - none of which are appropriate to feed a dog.At no stage through the book, does the author refer to scientific studies. Such studies abound, and the average dog person, who is invariably very confused as to what they should feed their dogs, feel frustrated that Mr Billinghurst has been unable to substantiate his claims.While Mr Billinghurst is heading towards the right track - ie: commercial pet foods are indeed poisonous to our dogs - his message needs considerable re-work (and a good editor please!) before being ready to hit the mass market. It's a pity he hasn't got his information correct before publishing this book.

For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern, there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician, out of necessity of his methodology, is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels, but more often than not, those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings, price, book value, growth, forward earnings, debt levels, etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation, but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also, anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets. Lacking a material event (earnings release, management shake-up, etc.) a company's price will largely be pulled around in lock-step w/ the broader market.These are known as the facts. The subject book is probably ok, but it starts w/ the wrong premise.

Even better when I'm learning something about events/ people I THOUGHT I knew something about - and when it's clever, well-written, and sometimes downright scandalous.I appreciated the mix of queens both famous (Anne Boleyn, Marie Antoinette, Catherine the Great, Princess Di) and those not so famous (queens of Romania and others). It also gave some fascinating insights into some of the KINGS ........ from their wives' points of view. As someone who enjoys history, but not an ardent STUDENT of history, I've always found it tedious and frustrating to read who's related to whom, who is who's cousin, etc. - something that is unavoidable in royal history, but somewhat annoying w my lack of history degree (and, sometimes, short attention span). The author did enough of this to make it relevant and interesting, but not so much to overwhelm the reader.I had only one problem with this book. I took it on a trip, thinking I'd read it by the time I got home.

Chaucer's vulgar honesty makes it a timeless book, a book for all times. Although personally I oppose the chaucerian concepts on providence and fate while he has given enough reasoning to propogate it but what makes the stories great is that as each tale unfolds itself,there is inadvertantly enough evidence emanating from the tales which oppose the chaucerian philosphy itself.

I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper.

In fact, they are due for another book and I look forward to reading it. Having already read , "Influencer" and "Crucial Conversation" , I knew what to expect from these excellent writers with Crucial Confrontation.General OverviewThe reasons I love these books are because at the end of each book, they do a beautiful job of tying all together. For me this is extremely important. After reading 300+ pages, at the end they tell you, what does it all mean to me and how can I use these wonderful skills in my own life. They summarizes it all and give you specific examples that you can use NOW to become better skill person on handling high stake conversations or confrontations or influencing people or a group of people.They tell you to practice one specific skill a week until you get the hang of it. So many books spew theories and concepts and at the end say thank you very much and I hope you use what we just told you and you like what. How? where do I start? there is just too much information, etc, etc. On the opposite side, these incredible authors tell you exactly how to use the skills, they will say if there are two things you walk away from this book, they are, (example in this book, establish safety and describe the gap) and give you examples. There is so much I can say and praise these three books and especially Crucial Confrontation( my favorite)but I say only that I strongly recommend for you to pick one up and find out for yourself.Crucial ConfrontationThere is a three concept model that you use and these are the skills that good and excellent practitioners use when there is a crucial confrontation.The model has three component of Confrontation: The Before, The During and The After- with a Side Bar for unexpected contingenciesThe Before: This is when you plan how you going to confront this person, who betray your trust, or , started rumors or is out to get you. Is the WHAT and IF concept.WHAT exactly happened, and WHAT issue are you going to confront-get the facts, and usually there are many issues involved, that need to be confronted , they talked bad about you, they told a specific lie , but I believe the bigger issue is the relationship, this is a person who you trusted and is lying about you, The confrontation many times is the relationship, and that is what should be confronted. Also, it talks IF , you should confront the person. Is it worth it? what will you lose if you don't, how much is it bothering you.The second part of the equation, is not to get angry , you have to leave your emotions out of it. This is done what the authors call, MASTER MY STORY, think of reasons why this person is doing it ( besides being just evil), the question to ask , why would a decent rational person do this. The idea is to make the person , human and not a villain and it that way to approach it in a more normal conversation and not going in there half cocked and ready to do battle.Real important in this phase is to ask yourself: What do I really want out of this confrontation? This will keep you focus. Also, a technique you can use in this phase is called CPR: C=Content( facts) P=Pattern( this is the second time) last R= relationship(trust).During the confrontation: the authors called it, DESCRIBE THE GAP. this is where you tell the story (facts) not conclusions, just the facts-of what is expected and what happened. The most important part of this is to create safety. Safety is created by stating the mutual purpose you both have and thinking before hand -what is the worse this person think I am saying and use contrast to say what you mean and not mean like I'm not accusing you of lying but I want to get the facts. Start with the facts (how you start, the first 10 seconds are crucial and set the tone for the confrontation it should start and end with a tentative question) and by ending with a question, it helps diagnose the problem. After you listen, look for motivation and ability. Make it motivating and make it easy for them and this has to do more with work , them personal relationships. The book says look at six sources of influence.After the confrontation- AGREE ON A PLAN AND FOLLOW UP. This basically means that you can tell the person, I can count on you for support - most important, Who does what , when and who will follow up and ask the question, are we leaving out any barriers or unforeseen things. Let discuss this in 30 days and we where we are, this is very important-remember mutual purpose.And the side bar, STAY FOCUS AND FLEXIBLE, and what that means, they might throw in another problem and you have to decide deal with the new problem, is it more serious (if you do, you bookmark the original problem and say we'll get back to that later, let discuss this new situation I was not aware of) , if the new problem is a small or distracting tactic, you get back to the original problem.I love this book, Buy it, read it and it will definitely improve your life with people..

The Dorling Kindersley retellings are not only short and elegant to read, but unfamiliar items are illustrated and explained right on the page. No searching around for the picture or definition of a &quot;lulag&quot; or &quot;shekel.&quot; This makes the DK version especially &quot;user-friendly&quot; and understandable by kids. The wealth of scholar/consultants from different religious traditions assures that it authoritative and equally useful to kids of different religious backgrounds. The DK Children's Bible has become my gift of choice for newborns, whether the parents are dedicated Christians or only those who want their kids to see the Bible as great literature. A truly wonderful book.

Wade and the Watergate tapes case. However, it is far from obsolete. The Brethren is a still-unprecedented look into the Supreme Court, the most secretive top-level branch of government. Although the faces (save one) and the cases are different, the way in which cases are decided by this body has likely not, plus it is a look at a tumultous time in ours as well as the Court's history.The focus of the story is Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger, who replaces Earl Warren after his retirement. The irony of the names is unexplored, but it is appropriate, because Burger becomes progressively preoccupied with trying to match Warren's legacy. Unlike Warren, though, he allows political concerns and vanity to influence his judgment and, bit by bit, erode the confidence of his colleagues, to the point where the late William Rehnquist, then a young conservative on the Court, makes fun of him behind his back. Although this book is unflattering to some of the justices, such as Thurgood Marshall, who is noted as lazy and uninvolved and Byron White, who is noted to be unlikeable, Burger is the biggest loser here. The book was published in the early 80s, only a few years before Burger left the court, and the image of him as a pompous, preening, intellectually deficient and generally clueless politician cost him, big time. In spite of the landmark rulings his Court made, he was unable to reverse the Warren Court's liberal activism (as he had hoped to do). His "Minnesota Twin", Harry Blackmun, would drift further away from him, both politically and personally, until finally becoming the most liberal justice after the departure of Thurgood Marshall in 1991. Burger's Macchiavellian strategizing to assign opinions caused such a backlash that, at one point, William Brennan decides to vote for whatever side of a case puts him in the minority so that Burger won't be able to assign him another crappy oppinion.Ultimately, Burger had good intentions, but his blunders dominate the book. He is a fascinating character, almost as bad a manager and as delusional as David Brent from the recent BBC TV Series The Office. Some of the principals come out looking good: Potter Stewart, for example, and Brennan also. But Rehnquist comes out best, in spite of some scheming and obfuscation. Burger, though, is front and center, and he's a reminder of how we're to seriously we all should take the business of the Court.

I started banjo about a year ago, and bought other books first- Peter Wernick's BlueGrass Banjo in the Oak Publications series, all of which books are great; Tony Triska's book and video, also very good; and Earl Scrugg's book, essential reading for bluegrass pickers. I just got this book yesterday and started looking it over. I now wish I had started with this one.Janet's teaching style is to progressively teach fundamentals and immediately apply them to repertoire, which is more fun, satisfying, and reinforcing than just reading about them and using them in a smaller number of songs. There are a lot of tunes in here! When you finish you will be able to play a number of tunes for yourself, family and friends, and with others. I can see progressing much more quickly with this book than the others because of that.There is enough material in here to keep a beginning student busy for at least 6 months to 1 year I think. You also get up the neck and melodic style introductions in addition to Scruggs style. And definitely get the CD at least-not only does it illustrate what these licks and songs are supposed to sound like, but contains teaching explanations, and it has both slow and fast speeds so you can judge your progress. The advantage of the CD is also motivational- you can listen to the lessons ahead of working them, and think "soon I'll be able to play that!"- and with practice you will be able. If you are lucky to find a guitar student or player to back you up, you will have loads of fun!Yes, it IS a beginner's book only- read the title- "You can teach yourself banjo". For more advanced techniques and material, you can and should look elsewhere. Forget the cover, and rip it off if you have to- there is good beginning fundamental material in here in a friendly and workable approach!

I never thought of myself as a truly serious baker, although I've always preferred baking to actually &quot;cooking&quot;--but this book has made my reputation--to the point where I've now been asked to bake a cake for a friend's wedding (so of course, I've just ordered the Cake Bible!) I think the scientific explanations are interesting, but just skip them if you don't have time to read a treatise. Also, I found it REALLY helpful to carefully read the recipe--the day before you start baking, if possible--so that you're not stuck waiting for butter to freeze or fruit to macerate when your guests are starting to arrive! The results are spectacular--the pear tart was perfection and I've never had any of my attempts fail, which is more than I can say for both Bon Appetit and Gourmet recipes.

It starts with his rough childhood in an orphanage - which was basically a reform school - and how the Babe just excelled and became a natural player and hitter. It goes on and chronicles his rowdy life on and off the field, his indulgences and his mishaps until his premature death. He was not a man of moderation or a person that was able to pace his life. He was the opposite of say the current but now retired " Iron Man" Cal Ripken also from near Baltimore but a person famous for moderation. "The Babe"would often show up with a hangover and little sleep for a game. Then he would stuff himself with hotdogs during a game and still knock the ball out of the park.He was a fascinating person, bigger than life, and every baseball fan must buy or borrow and read this book.

At the time of this review I have already looked at "Go Tell It On The Mountain", "Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone", and "If Beale Street Could Talk." Frankly those works, while well written and powerful, did not altogether remind me why I was crazy to read everything that Baldwin wrote when I was a kid. The Baldwin black liberation manifesto (and, maybe, white liberation as a by-product), "The Fire Next Time", "spoke" to me then and after forty years still "speaks" to me now in so-called "post-racial" Obama time.Back in the early 1960s I used to listen to a late night talk show on the local radio station in Boston. Many times the host would have Malcolm X on and the airwaves would light up with his take on white racism, black nationalism and the way forward for the black liberation struggle- and away from liberal integrationism. Now in those days I was nothing but a woolly-headed white, left liberal "wannabe" bourgeois politico kid who believed in black liberation but in the context of working within the prevailing American society. I was definitely, and adamantly, opposed to the notion of a separate black state on the American continent if for no other reason that it would look something like the then existing ghettos, writ large, that I was committed to getting rid of and a set up for black genocide if things got too hot. And I still am. So, on the one hand, I admired, and I really did, Malcolm X for "speaking truth to power" on the race question while on the other disagreeing with virtually every way he wanted to achieve it.Now that scenario is the predicate for James Baldwin's assuredly more literary, but seemingly more hopeful, way of getting the thread of the Malcolm X message about white racism out while posing the possibility (or, maybe, necessity) of joint struggle to get rid of it. In my recent re-reading of "The Fire Next Time" I was struck by how much of Baldwin's own hard-fought understandings on the question of race intersected with The Nation Of Islam, Malcolm at the time, and Elijah Mohammad's. Oddly, I distinctly remember debating someone, somewhere on the question of black nationalism and using Baldwin's more rational approach as a hammer against the black nationalists. I probably overdrew his more balanced view of a multiracial American then, if not now.Still, Jimmy was onto something back then. Something that airy-headed kids like me, who thought that once the struggle in the South was won then the struggle in the North could be dealt with merely by a little fine-tuning, were clueless about. Don't smirk. But do note this: while only a fool or political charlatan, would deny that there have been gains for the black population since those civil rights struggle days the pathology of racism and, more importantly, the hard statistics of racism (housing segregation, numbers in the penal system, unemployment and underemployment rates, education, and a whole range of other factors) tell a very different story about how far blacks really have come over the last half century. A story that makes "The Fire Next Time" read like it could have been written today. And to be read today. Thanks, Jimmy.

I knit and have done so for a long time. Only recently after discovering novelty yarn and the first Stitch 'n' Bitch book did I start really enjoying knitting. That said, I was very excited when the "Happy Hooker" came out because I want to get excited about crocheting as well.I can't speak for all new crocheters, but I have the ability to read pictures and learn techniques from books and if I wasn't the type that couldn't do that, if I needed hands on instruction then I wouldn't criticize a book because the author doesn't pop out of the book to show you herself.The pictures and the instruction in this book are so helpful, more so than in the first Stitch 'n' Bitch. I pictures are in color and the patterns range from easy to advance, and the yarns used range from cheap Red Heart Yarn to expensive quality yarns.If you don't watch MTV all day long then you will probably be annoyed with some of the language in the book but its geared towards a younger generation. Stoller is getting a younger crowd interested in a craft she enjoys...and I think that is amazing. Hell she got me!The patterns are fun to look at and look fun make and fun to wear, tote around, and use. There is a skull pot holder, string bikini, a man's beanie hat, and the cool Cowboy Hat that she wears on the cover.This book takes crochet into the 21st century. The lastest fashion designers incorporate knit and crochet pieces into their designs and here is a book that can help you to make those designs on your own.

In this book, she helps explain without pomp and complexity how to add magic and witchcraft into "EVERYDAY" life without it costing you a fortune in unnecessary items. This was the first book I had read on Witchcraft well over 10 years ago and it still stands above the rest. Cabot is the only female writer of Witchcraft that deserves praise above and beyond her male contemporaries. She doesn't just put pen to paper to make a few $$$, she very much lives the lifestyle, works extensively to dispel the myths surrounding the practice of Witchcraft, works tirelessly for better understanding and rights for those that do practice Witchcraft, Paganism & Wicca. She also explains well how one can be Christian AND practice this noble and ancient religion, it will certainly surprise you! If you are serious about understanding Witchcraft but not sure where to start - this book should be the first on the subject in your library!

As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject. The reports of the battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate. One can almost imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney, Marmont, or Junot. Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the events surrounding his death. Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic legend helped to shape post-Imperial France. I would recomend this book to anyone who would like to know more about this facinating historical figure.

Add Dennis Miller in addition to Eddie Murphy as to the small number of people that aren't represented in the book. It would have been all the better if they had participated. That said, if you had a decent amount of exposure to the show throughout its tenure, this eminently readable book is like a time machine; reading it, I couldn't help but pair memories of what I was doing throughout the different seasons and cast changes, and was surprised at how much of SNL still resonates, bad or good. All of the controversies are touched upon--Sinead O'Connor's tearing the picture of the Pope, Andrew Dice Clay's appearance, battles with the censors and so on. The book also confirmed a few things for me--how much of a jerk Chevy Chase seems to be, how ill-fitting cast members seem to resent the show (witness the incredibly negative vibe from Janeane Garofalo)--and some performers/writers I never really thought much of before come off as incredibly down-to-earth and kind. And, as might be assumed, a lot of the focus falls on Lorne Michaels (the book's final chapter is devoted to deciphering the man, to no avail, of course). I'm kind of interested in what makes shows like this fail, and I could have had even more details from when the show really tanked, but this is a minor complaint. All around, this will probably be the SNL book to have for a long time to come.

Unless you are a devoted scientist, you will probably never read his book, The Origin of Species, his journals, or his autobiography. Alan Moorehead has done a valuable service in providing an entertaining popular introduction to Darwin's work in this book (available now as an audio cassette).Darwin's life is full of ironies, which are nicely developed in this book. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, was a well-known physician who espoused some elementary ideas about biological evolution. Is finding evolution a heritable trait?Charles Darwin had been a poor student, and seemed only competent to become a country curate.The position of naturalist on the Beagle was cooked up because the captain was subject to mental illness, and hoped the companionship of another educated person would help him keep his senses.Darwin initially turned the job down because his father was opposed, and was only able to persuade his father to let him pursue this when a relative aggressively intervened.Darwin's main qualification for the position was that his family could afford the 500 pounds it would cost to be on the voyage while conducting this unpaid position.Also, Darwin got horribly sea sick, which meant that he sought out opportunities to be on land as much as possible (this was fortunate for the future of biology).Finally, Darwin was a believer in strict creationism when he started the voyage. He saw his job, in part, as finding evidence for Noah's flood.The voyage of the Beagle lasted five years, and involved circumnavigating the globe. The primary purpose of the Beagle's trip was to map coastlines for the admiralty.Most people know about Darwin's finches (whose beaks developed in different ways in various islands in the Galapagos to reflect the local food supplies), but do not realize that he only spent a few days in the Galapagos.He had many other important experiences in South America and on other Pacific islands that led him to appreciate how geological processes of mountain building and ocean depressing impacted species. The fossils he found in Uraguay and Argentina of extinct animals began to undermine his belief in the literal meaning of the Bible on these points. Finding other fossils from ocean creatures at 12,000 feet high in the Andes further stretched his mind. Seeing extreme volcanic action and the effects of tidal waves in Chile added to the picture.This material would be ideal for a young person trying to find what interests them. It will encourage the idea of being open to new experiences, and learning from what you observe. Many young people would like scientific careers if they ever tried one. High school and college science classes give an incomplete and poor impression of what working in science is all about. This book nicely captures the excitement of field work and trying to figure out what the data mean.I graded the book down for being too popularized and a little too repetitive. Readers can absorb more substantive information than Mr. Moorehead included here.A good way to apply what you learn in this book is to observe a group of animals over time. Take notes on what you see. Find a way to determine patterns from your notes. Then consider reasons why these behaviors could be beneficial to the animals. Then ask yourself what genetic and behavioral influences may bear on this behavior. You have now created a hypothesis. How can it be tested?An excellent book about our modern understanding of Darwin's work can be found in The Beak of the Finch, which is the first published work on how natural selection works in practice from observing many generations of Darwin's finches.Be open to all that is around you . . . to get the most out of life!

After reading the entire book I was still unable to grasp how Struts worked, and more importantly, how to write my own Struts-based application.&quot;Struts in Action&quot;, on the other hand, was exactly what I needed. Struts is explained, part by part, as you go about creating sample applications of increasing complexity.

I read the book that same week and I must say that I was very happy about my impulse buy. Mr. Nutman paints a very vivid picture of the end of the world and I would like to say to those out there who condemn the splatterpunk genre, that they should read this story before making a fool of themselves furthur. Richly descriptive and horrifying, this is what horror fiction is all about. Its like a nightmare written on page with all the claustrophobia and despair of a zombie invasion present. I have to make a personal confession. I rarely remember my dreams, but I sometimes do when they are nightmares. My worst nightmares have been about the living dead taking over the world and consuming the living. Its like Mr. Nutman took the anarchy, terror, and hopelessness of one of these dreams and made it his own. The characters are well structured, the pace of the tale furious, the story well realised. The only drawback: too damn short! I can only imagine what an epic length would have brought forth, such as the scale of the Stand or Swan Song. Mr. Nutman, do me a favor. Write more more more!

This book, written in 1954, is just as pertinent today (perhaps even more so, as it's so easy to acquire statistics due to our current technology) -- Darrell Huff gives people the tools to talk back to statistics. Though there is a little bit about deliberate deception, in such things as &quot;The Gee-Whiz Graph&quot; (about how the graphical display of statistics can be twisted so that one can get any desired result, though the stats aren't changed), the meat of the book is regarding sound statistical reasoning, something that people today really need to consider.For example, every person who listens to the latest survey showing a correlation between certain food and certain health problems or benefits should read &quot;Post Hoc Rides Again&quot;, in which people erroneously leap from statistical correlation to a cause-and-effect relationship. An example given in the book is a report in which it was found that smokers had lower grades in college; ergo, said the researcher, smokers wishing to improve their grades should quit smoking! Of course, a statistical study showing that there's a &quot;significant&quot; relation between smoking and low grades doesn't show which causes the other -- perhaps educational failure draws people to smoke! My own theory would be that the =type= of person who is given to smoking is also given to not doing well in school; instead of cause and effect, one has a correlation from a shared, third (and unnamed) cause. One comes across these fallacies in the news =every=day=; I've been reading my online news, and in the science section I've already found two suspicious cause-and-effect reports. As Huff notes, it's not the statistics which are in question -- it's how they're used.Some of the figures and examples used are funny due to their datedness (I love the picture of the surveyor asking a doctor what brand of cigarette he smokes, and the cigar-smoking baby just makes me smirk). It seems to me if you multiply every monetary amount by 10, you might get a better idea as to what it's worth (I don't know what it is actually worth, as I don't know what the inflation from 1954 is (another suspicious statistic)).More to the point, with the help of this book, you need not have blind faith in the numbers or disgustedly throw all stats away. The mathematics of statistics guarantees them to have great power, as long as you know how to interpret them correctly. You might be pleasantly surprised to find that more common sense than math is involved in this book, but the truth is most modern abuse of numbers happens well after the numbers have been calculated. Of course, once you talk back to statistics people may think you're crazy; at least you won't be fleeced by false reasoning.

I was skeptical that eye exercises and common-sense precautions against excessive eye strain could restore and now preservie my distance vision (I was myopic). Not anymore. In one year I improved my vision from 20/120 in my right eye and 20/100 in my left, to 20/40 in both eyes -- enough improvement to pass my driver's license eye examination. I'd been wearing glasses and contact lenses for 30 years! Now I carry a very weak pair of glasses (-.5 lenses) in my car just in case my eyes are particularly fatigued late at night. I have them on about once a month. My question: Why didn't anybody tell me that I could save my vision by avoiding excessive close-up strain (which, as it turns out, is easy to do) and by doing simple exercises? Shouldn't I have gotten that information from my opthamologist? If you're a myopic parent who doesn't want your children to also lose their eyesight, by all means get this book. Save your kids' vision and restore your own. Add eye fitness to your regimen of jogging and weight lifting and healthy dieting. You'll be amazed at the results.

He also deals with many of the predicted prophecies of a catastrophic event. Greg Braden writes that mass prayer is the tool to achieve peace and change. "We all know that prayers are energy," and when used in the right way can bring about changes to peoples lives and the environment! But he is right in saying, it will depend on the peoples choice and the amount of effort they put into it. He is a fortunate person in as far as he is able to travel to many ancient and sacred sites to experience firsthand the phenomena. Greg Braden's idea on that hope and prayer can change the world is not a new one, but is is a very good and convincing one and he makes the readers aware of this.Hans Liszikam, author of "The God Code in the Seven"

One would expect such an authoritative volume on baking to come from a chunky Frenchman with a very tall toque and an accent you can cut with a pastry knife, not from the ever so sweet and coy face smiling at you from the back of the dust jacket of this very large book on a very serious subject. But, this book from this author should be no surprise at all, as it is the middle volume on a trilogy that does for baking what Tolkein did for epic fantasy in `Lord of the Rings'.Before I even start to talk about the virtues of the book, just consider the difference in content you are receiving from Rose Levy Beranbaum's three books when compared to Ina Garten's three cookbooks. For a 30% addition to the price, Beranbaum is giving you approximately 300% more information. Another comparison is to compare Beranbaum's 2000 pages with the very authoritative sounding `King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion' weighing in at a mere 607 pages. That is just to put these works in perspective.To most newbies, cooking may seem relatively easy, but one glimpse at what you need to make a decent pie crust has most novices running to the megamart refrigerated cases for those premade Pillsbury pie crusts. First, you have to pick the right ingredients. Can I use all-purpose flour or should I use pastry flour. Can I use King Arthur or should I use White Lily? Should I use butter or vegetable shortening or lard? Should I add vinegar or not? Should I add an egg yolk or not? Then, you have to be concerned about the weather. Is the barometer rising or falling? Is the air humid or dry? Then comes the technique. Do I use a pastry cutter or do I use my hands? How long do I work the flour and fat before adding the liquid? How much do I work it after adding the liquid? How long do I rest it before rolling it out? How do I lay the crust in the pan to avoid shrinking? What kind of pan do I use to bake the pie? Do I blind bake the crust for this pie? How long do I bake? What do I look for to know the bottom crust is done?I'm exaggerating a little because many of these variables are usually well enough in control that they don't ruin a pie. But, every variable offers a way for things to go wrong. Now, millions of people, myself included, have successfully made good pie crusts without having read Ms. Beranbaum's book, but millions of people, myself included, have made pie crusts which just didn't make the grade. Rose Levy Beranbaum tells you why, and gives you all the information you need to avoid each and every problem.One of the very few problems I find with Ms. Beranbaum's work is that there is so much information, it is difficult to whip out a simple recipe or find the solution to a simple problem without literally studying the information for some time. But, the only thing that means is that this book, however good, may not be for everyone. For the casual baker of pies, I strongly recommend Wayne Harley Brachman's `American Desserts'.Ms. Beranbaum's book is for the serious baker and for people who really like to read about baking in order to troll for ideas and projects. The depth of information exceeds virtually every other work I have seen so far. Where other books give you measurements by both weight and volume, Ms. Beranbaum gives you measurements in both Metric and English system units. Where others recommend a fat to use, Ms. Beranbaum explains why the fat of choice should be used and how to make intelligent substitutions with various kinds of ingredients. While I have not yet read Shirley Corriher's book `Cookwise', Rose gives me the same kind of intimate knowledge of my ingredients and techniques as I would expect from Shirley. Rose even quotes Shirley's recipe for Southern biscuits as the model recipe for same.Speaking of biscuits, if I were to write a tutorial on pastry making, I would probably start with biscuits. As Beranbaum points out, the techniques and results when making biscuits stand you almost exactly halfway between pastry crusts and cake making. I would add that it also puts you very close to the bread baking world, with a product where the time between cracking open the flour canister and pulling the finished product out of the oven can be less than 30 minutes. This makes biscuit baking a perfect intro. to baking in general. Needless to say, Ms. Beranbaum covers biscuits with her usual thoroughness.I would very strongly recommend this and all of Ms. Beranbaum's books on baking as a perfect second book on their respective subjects. As a first book, get `Baking with Julia' and follow the directions with the diligence of a Viennese pastry master. Very highly recommend to those in love with baking. How can you possibly resist so sweet a smile on Ms. Beranbaum's face as she kneads her dough on the dust jacket?

Here is our history told as it was, not as we might wish it to be, and I for one appreciate the factual account. Hutton is extremely sensitive and sympathetic (even supportive) of wicca as a valid relgion - and he is respectful to all of our founding fathers and mothers. He has obviously given great care to his research and respect to the pagans he contacted. I am astounded at how much he genuinely seems to like our religion and our people.Every pagan should own this book, and every trad leader and hp should have this on their required reading list.

This book lays out object oriented code for four of the most common types of neural networks and explains every property and function in detail. If you are looking for a book on neural network theory this is not it. If you are looking for code samples that let you build basic networks and play with them yourself this book is perfect.

Have you ever watched a movie or play, and at the end of it you say, &quot;I don't get it&quot;? ---&gt; But everyone around you says it was the greatest thing they have ever seen... well, I will not pretend to be a pseudo-intellectual. Ibsen was way over my head with this book.Superficially the book was extremely interesting from the standpoint of: will one man be willing to stand up to a city when he knows what is right? In our story, the protagonist has discovered that the Norwegian baths are filled with a poisonous organism. However, when he voices this, the entire town goes against him because it will cost them economically, and they put the pressure on him to refute that which he knows is correct. From that standpoint - the book is excellent... and we are held to find the outcome.Where it lost me personally was when Ibsen went on his political diatribe. He further alienated me via his pages of discussion on liberalism in a manner that seemed conservative to me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed these speeches as well, and they admittedly felt more contemporary Republican than Liberal Democrat.In the end, I would have to recommend this book, but say "Feel free to not understand." It is okay to embrace that not everything is clear, and at times his points are lost on minds as dull as mine. Embrace your ignorance, and enjoy it for what it is

It is not a &quot;Faces of Death&quot; book of gore. Obviously, the book chronicles deaths within the Park and is therefore not exactly light reading. But, Mr. Whittlesley (the official NPS Yellowstone archivist) tells the stories of the deaths with a historian's tact. There are few - if any - people on earth that know as much about the park as Whittlesley. One version of his &quot;Yellowstone Place Names&quot; (the longer version of the one sold in tourist stores and on Amazon.com)is so comprehensive it is (only?) available on microfiche!Having lived in the Park, I know it's a very different world. (The story noted by Rhonda, another reviewer, about the bison goring a car - a Lake Lodge employee's Geo Metro in 1991 - is actually quite true.) Many of the deaths are from things you might think of - like climbing falls, eating poisonous plants, and hot pot incidents. Even as I am writing this, another Old Faithful employee died yesterday (8/22/00) in the Park after falling into Cavern Spring in Lower Geyser basin (see Idaho Statesman, 8/23/00, p.2A). But, the book is also full of deaths of the kind you find everywhere else in the world - like heart attacks, suicide, murders (yes, several!), car accidents, plane crashes (six of them - one site of which I've visited - with 20 deaths!), etc. The earliest chronicled deaths are in 1839 and continue through 1994.Some of the over 300 incidents are briefly related as the facts are slim. Others are told in great detail with quotes, newspaper stories, cemetery inscriptions and exact place names. The simple chronology takes up 5 pages, while the meat of the text takes 198 pages! If you are expecting John Grisham's spellbinding fiction and twists and conspiracy, then this book is not for you. If you want a very well told, fascinating historical look at Yellowstone from a different point of view, then this is the book for you.

But was it just their vivid imagination or did they really hear someone knocking on the door? It is up to the reader to figure that out.

Granted, because I have umpired some Little League games (and hope to umpire more), I may have more interest in this topic than the typical reader. However, I think even the &quot;typical reader&quot; would enjoy this book. I kept thinking that I did not want the book to end. A sequel would be more than welcome!The interviews are laid out well and the reading is easy and entertaining. It is tied together well so that it does not seem like a jumble of questions and answers (it is not a question-and-answer format, but more of a prose format).You get a feel for the game that you may never have gotten before. You get to hear a little about some of the great names of baseball (Williams, DiMaggio, Robinson, etc.) from a new perspective. It is amazing how similar all the different umpires feel about some players and managers. It certainly heightened my respect for the game, especially for the Men in Blue.

In my case I am preparing for my University Comprehensive Exams for my Master's program. The book covers all the major areas which will be covered in the exam. A unique feature is the programmed text-like nature of the questions. Not only is the correct answer listed and why, but also the rationale why the other possible selections were not correct. Rosenthal also refers back to previous questions to aid in comprehension. A nice feature are some memory devices to aid in recall of commonly missed questions or concepts. (The Independent Variable-who controls it? Remember the "I"-I control it)This text is well worth the price. It won't take the place of reviewing your own material, but will help prepare you to take a multiple choice exam.

Given that his most recent book &quot;The Punch&quot; was released recently, I figured Feinstein hastily put this book together to cash in the upsurge in interest in golf. I WAS WRONG and am happy to admit it.The author once again takes us on the &quot;inside&quot; and proffers the reader another dose of history, tradition, and day to day banter of those who help stage the world's greatest (and most democratic) championship. Feinstein grabs the reader with his poignant insights and an introduction to the jargon of those in the know (How many people will be correcting their foursomes on pin placements vs. hole locations?).The 2002 Open was truly a special and spectacular event held so close to New York during an historical time and truly an Open for the people. Feinstein does justice with this well written and easy to read tome. In fact I found myself wanting more.I noticed in the thank you portion at the end of the book that he thanks dozens of golfers, but did not mention the 2002 Champion, Tiger Woods. I really thought there might have been more on Tiger, but maybe John has been frozen out of the inner circle due to his book &quot;The First Coming: Tiger Woods: Master or Martyr&quot; Feinstein has alienated subjects in the past (right Bob Knight), but sometimes showcasing the &quot;inside&quot; leads to people reading unflattering things about themselves they wish to hide. It's the author who has to live with himself with those relationships; however once again I found myself enraptured in great sports book by Feinstein.Write on John!

His memoir of having been there at the birth of "Follies" is rich and delightful. Every person who finds themselves being glib at the expense of a new work in the theatre ought to read this book, because Chapin illuminates the perilous path of collaborative art -- the expense financially, physically, emotionally. In the words of Tommy Tune, "Contrary to popular opinion, the theatre is not for sissies." I loved hearing about the extraordinary amount of work that everyone did -- how many fears they had to face, how much was on the line for them. I'm so glad I read this book, and so grateful it exists. It is a wonderful resource for theatre students and young professionals. And it is simply a terrific read for anyone in love with theatre and what makes artists tick.

The book offers a good overview of some very ominous trends. Something I wish he had spent more time on is counter-vailing trends like the world-wide growth in renewables, the rise of progressive spirituality (see New Dimensions Broadcasting or Sojo.net), and the expanding tentacles of honest media (Free Speech TV, documentaries like "The Corporation," and publishers like New Society and South End Press).The other issue I have is with the term "Christian fundamentalism." It seems many of the people who promote or have been ensnared by this imperial theology have little to do with the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ. Rather, Satan seems to be the guiding force of the right-wing and its lust for money, its cultivation of confusion, and its celebration of militarism. The crosses currently used as an accoutrement should be replaced with pentagrams; or maybe Pentagons.For more info on satanic fundamentalism, I'd recommend the books and blog of Chip Berlet."When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross." -Upton Sinclair

This book was amazing, I think everyone on the planet should read it.The two points he made that stuck out to me were:1) in his piece about parenting, he talks about how (ideally) mothers have to love their children so much, unconditionally and in every circumstance -- and then *let them go.* He talks about differences in fatherly love [fathers discipline, give praise and love when you're successful], and concludes that at adulthood, people need to find a way to give themselves *both* fatherly and motherly love from the inside, regardless of how their childhood went...2) he talks about concentration and attentiveness, and how it relates to fatigue and mental health. he speaks at length about what it means to really concentrate and not be scattered doing a hundred things at once, and how, when you've concentrated hard on something, you're tired and sleep well vs. when you are all over the place, focusing on one thing for two minutes and moving on, you feel tired but it's hard to fall asleep. This resonated with me and my terrible reading and Internet habits!It is a beautiful book -- obviously some concepts are a bit out-dated, such as the ways in which he tries to incoporate gay relationships in his parts about love. But how amazing is it that he's trying to think through and incorporate gay men and women's experiences at all? I was impressed. He really spoke from a place of love and IMHO speaks the truth as it is.

Clear, concise: lots of good diagrams, very interesting satelite photos, excellent chapter summaries and really thought provoking practice questions.Starts with the basics (atmospheric dynamics) and gets into a little depth (ocean currents, no pun intended). This book is the perfect introduction to oceanography. But it's a tiny bit dated, published in 1989; not clear if it's been updated in its 1995 printing. We've learned a lot more about the oceans since then, especially Japanese research on The Pipeline: two thousand years to complete a single circuit.Our planet, while probably not unique, is a truly marvellously complex system. This book shows how the anthropic principle is operating, and the unlikelihood of finding another planet that would suit us as well, which is a strong argument in favor of terra forming.This book is the second in a set of three on physical oceanography. Really worth the time and effort (and money) to read the set.

I thought this book was very good and descriptive in what happened to the teenager's lives and the victims of the Holocaust. It was sad to know how well-off Americans in the U.S. and other fortunate people had it then. When I was reading, it was sad to picture how hard it would be then for not just teenagers but everyone,especially when they talked about how they didn't want to die yet and the shame and humiliation they felt as jews. I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others. But I would have liked it more if he would have described more about what the Nazis would do to the victims after they were transported. Otherwhise, I liked this book very much.

Martinez "Carl Martez"	9	16	2004-12-18 20:39:05+08	Somebody Save This Story	This hardcover edition of Mark Waid's SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT looks and feels beautiful but the story only simplifies the classic characters while attempting to blend in TV's Smallville. The first chapter is truly fresh with a look at how young Clark is influenced to assume a new identity and become a role model for others, but then the story's focus switches to unoriginal action & dialogue. Some character relationships are changed from the current DC history to closer resemble the popular Smallville storyline but nothing truly original is added. It should also be mentioned that the ink on the pages easily smudged from simply touching the page.Mark Waid has previously co-written one of comics top three greatest works; KINGDOM COME. With artist Alex Ross, this future storyline features an older Superman returning to lead the Justice League against the threat of a new generation of reckless heroes. Waid and Ross no longer speak to each other because of disagreements as to who exactly was the true author of the tale. Most fans believe it is Ross with whom the story resonates more personally with his past, and after reading Birthright the differences in the quality of storytelling becomes obvious.SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT feels more like the work of a company changing its image to please TV fans who might buy a comic instead of being what it could have which is the writer combining the best elements of all versions of Superman. For Superman's origin story I suggest reading John Byrne's MAN OF STEEL, which is beautifully drawn, has original yet logical changes, and overall is closest to what Superman means.

I wonder why Silver didn't take these 100-odd pages, add a bit more information, and make a sequel to TEEN WITCH as opposed to placing them at the end of this Book of Shadows. The Book of Shadows is plenty large as it is. However, being as I'd have bought either I suppose I can consider them a bonus here; I just hope other readers aren't put off by the inclusion of this information and think this is another book geared for kids.The rest of the book, however, is really an any-age collection for the Solitary Wiccan. Silver tackles questions like: the difficulty/challenges with calling oneself a Christian Witch, to use or not use blades in ritual, and other issues that aren't discussed in the typical Wicca 101 books. Plus, lots of great spells and ideas. With its sheer size, this book is real value for the money. While the encyclopedia-type format with its alphabetical order listings isn't as outright readable as her prior New Generation Witchcraft titles, this is the kind of book you can leave open on your coffee table and read a few headings at a time.If anything, this reminds me of a much more readable, accessible and friendly version of Raymond Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft.

For the first hundred or so pages of "In The Beginning," I thought I was reading a novel about a boy growing up in New York City during the Depression. Then it became a book about his obsessive passion for studying Talmud. I found myself reading a book about someone else reading books, an experience rather dry and insular.David Lurie is a bright but sickly child who observes and questions everything, beginning with a photograph showing his father and family friends back in Poland. They appear armed. Why? And why is his father so angry, and why do so many of the non-Jews of his Bronx neighborhood hate him? His questioning, it turns out, is the mark of great brilliance which will blossom in the form of Talmudic scholarship and a hunger for learning beyond what is taught in his synagogue.Published in 1975, "In The Beginning" works the same ground as Potok's earlier, more celebrated novel, "The Chosen." David, like Danny Saunders in "The Chosen," is a prodigy of dazzling intellect who struggles with the pain of what to do with his preternatural talent. The main difference is David isn't Hasidic like Danny."The Chosen" works as a story of friendship, of spiritual triumph, even - metaphorically - of Israel's birth. "In The Beginning" as a story isn't as simple, or as broadly compelling once it starts to take form. This time Potok bores in more specifically on conflictive elements of the Jewish experience, including American anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and the challenge of observance amid growing unbelief. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy "The Chosen." "In The Beginning" is less ecumenical.It's also not much fun. There are no baseball games here, or sportive or romantic diversions of any kind. David is written as a superkid when it comes to learning, which is fine, but he seems to lack for a life. By age ten he is already reading Talmudic scholars in multiple languages, and killing himself with sleepless study. The fate of his faith, it seems, rests on his small shoulders. "Davey eats books," as his brother puts it, and his conversations center around how this ancient scholar disagrees with that scholar, or mistranslates some Biblical verse.A little later, David explains his need not only to study Talmud, but pore over the learning until he can visualize it. "I think you want too much," his father says. "You are only eleven."The novel also suffers from a repetitious formula. Davey gets sick. Davey has visions and fantasias connected with the plight of the Jews. Davey recovers, and performs great feats. This repeats all the way through to the end.The first hundred or so pages aren't great, but they do set the book up in such a way I was left wanting more than I got. Potok was a masterful word painter, and his simple declarative phrases craft a kind of lived-in world you feel as much as read. There's an old man sitting by a stoop, his palsied hands shaking in the sun. There's a goat in the zoo who lets little Davey pet its bristly chin. David's father agonizes about having brought so many of his fellow Poles to America only to mire them in the Great Depression, not realizing of course the fact that getting them out of Poland has saved their lives. Then the reading begins, and the story's focus narrows to a pinpoint.For Potok, the fate of the Jews in Poland must have mattered more than telling a story of a David Copperfield in the yeshiva. "In The Beginning" reflects this, and you can't disagree with the author's sense of priorities. But I was left wanting for the immersive outreach and cleaner narrative structure Potok had proved himself able to deliver.

Referring to the accounts as &quot;a real eye-opener,&quot; THS historian Don Lynch, who recently sailed with Pellegrino on James Cameron's 3-D Imax filming expedition to the Titanic, found the author to be a true seeker, blessed with hyper-energy and an undying sense of wonder that makes him seem at times like an overgrown child, &quot;if not occasionally like a class 1-A pain in the neck... but a lovable pain in the neck&quot;. As for the availability of the library, Pellegrino has begun to post it on his web site, fully annotated, and downloadable by an &quot;honor system&quot; by which readers will hopefully send donations to the Michael J. Fox organization for Parkinson's disease research (where Fox makes sure that every dime goes directly to research). This tells me everything I need to know about Pellegrino and the Titanic.

The many-roomed manors surrounded by lush gardens and populated with liveried footmen. From Pemberly to Chatsworth, from Manderly to Blenheim, the English country house has captivated American audiences as we wander from room to room in the ones now owned by the National Trust imagining what it must have been like to live in one of these palaces.Many books have been written on the English country house, but most are fawning photographic journeys into the picturesque, or architectural studies. This is by far the best comprehensive social history of the country house: warts and all. This book chronicles the rise of the estate, when the Empire was at its peak, London at its dirtiest and the cost of wiring and heating all those rooms was not an issue, to the years when these elegant status symbols became ridiculous white elephants that literally couldn't be given away... to their reemergance as cultural and historical artifacts and status symbols all at once.This book is well-researched and well-written, and offers a comprehensive view of all types of country houses: from the huge palaces to the little cottages that sprouted up in the Victorian period for the middle classes to enjoy. It even delves into the building rush of the 1980's, when the country home again became popular as the rich grew richer.If you are at all interested in English history, the history of the wealthy, or the history or architecture then this book is for you.

If you are a tourist who enjoys traveling to country houses this is also definately worth a read.

The development of the character gets lost in a horde of Goetic demons and otherworldly realms.One thing that puzzles me is the idea that somehow Promethea is a more authentically female superhero than those who have gone before, instead of being a &quot;man in a woman's body&quot; like Roger of the 5 Swell Guys. How is Promethea/Sophie (created by two men) more a real woman than Wonder Woman (created by William Moulton and Charles Gaines) or Buffy the Vampire Slayer (created by Joss Whedon)? At least the Bride of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; was created by a man and a woman.However, Moore on a bad day is still levels above plenty of other writers, so this is worth checking out.

As a written and oral communications trainer specializing in grammar, I needed the best reference manual I could find for my students. After reviewing dozens of them for over a decade, The Gregg Reference Manual by William Sabin continues to receive an A+ in my book. It's the only one I recommend because it is so comprehensive in scope, easy to use, and simple to understand. I take my copy with me everywhere I go.Working with varied groups as a grammar expert, I am concerned about receiving a question I can't answer. Thanks to The Gregg Reference Manual, that's never happened. I've found answers to questions about even the finest points of grammar as do my students. Regardless of the concept in question, the book is amazingly easy to navigate thanks to its unique index. Unlike others, this one does not simply contain page references. Instead, Mr. Sabin references the numerous and detailed subjects in his index to distinctly numbered and lettered paragraphs. Those paragraphs contain both clear explanations of the related rules along with enlightening examples that serve to clarify rather than complicate the issue in question.In my business, I have worked with thousands of business and government employees ranging from experts in English to those who can barely differentiate between a subject and a verb. Whatever their English expertise or lack thereof, I recommend this manual to everyone. Without exception, those who bought it are praising it for the reasons mentioned in this review and more. In addition, the price is right.Try it yourself, and join the myriad of other satisfied users who say, &quot;Gregg is great!&quot;

When we last saw John Carter, he had been accidentally transferred back to Earth, and away from his beloved Dejah Thoris. Well, obviously in a novel named "The Gods of Mars," he isn't going to stay on his home planet. But Edgar Rice Burroughs' second Barsoom novel introduces a whole new dilemma for our hero -- how to get back to the world of the living.John Carter returns to Mars, but is shocked to find that he's in a completely unfamiliar part of it, populated by grotesque Plant Men and white apes. After encountering his old friend Tars Tarkas, Carter learns that they are in the Barsoomian afterlife. The problem is, nobody can return from the pilgrimage to the River Iss -- and if anyone tries, they will be killed.But the greatest threat comes from two breeds of Martian that Carter has never seen before -- the Black Martian pirates and the White Martian Therns, both of whom consider themselves to be gods.Anyone who survives the valley is turned into a slave, and Carter soon makes new allies among his fellow captives. But even if he can escape the grasp of the "goddess" Issus, he may not be able to survive in a world where escaping from "death" is blasphemy -- especially when he finds that Dejah Thoris may be doomed as well."The Gods of Mars" is a much faster-moving story than the first Barsoom book, even though we're introduced to a whole new part of Mars and two new Martian species. Burroughs just plunges right into the main story right away, and it's a long time before he stops to contemplate the flora/fauna/customs of the Martians.Burroughs' prose is also more polished in this story, with longer action scenes and a faster pace -- as well as some moments that are absolutely horrifying (the plant men, with their corpselike skin, ragged noses and wormy hair). And while he still has the slight stuffiness of early 20th-century pulp, he injects a lot of vivid descriptions and action into the story.John Carter is still a bit on the Stuey side -- multiple women are in love with him by the story's end, for instance. But he's still a very strong character, with lots of guts and courage. Burroughs throws a rather unexpected twist into the story when Carter discovers that one of his fellow captives is actually related to him; and he also introduces some other interesting characters, such as the malignant Issus and the strong, proud Thuvia."The Gods of Mars" is one of the few sequels that is actually markedly better than the original book. But be warned: it leaves you dangling on a cliffhanger that will leave you scrabbling for the third book.

Add to that I've only read a few Koontz books in my lifetime and I went into this book with a lot of skepticism. In this re-imagining of the Mary Shelly works, the Frankenstein Monster, called Deucalion, has survived and is leading a quiet life in a Tibetan Monsastery. He's secreted away from the rest of the world, safe and sound. He then learns, however, that his creater Victor Frankenstein is alive and well, and living in New Orleans, mad as ever.Frankenstein is now a rich Tycoon, and is up to his old tricks of creating life, and hell-bent on replacing mankind with his laboratory spawned creations. Unlike the Lighting created patchwork of corpses, these new creatures have been created with the latest technology and been essentially grown in the lab, and designed to be perfect. When one of these "perfect" creations escapes and becomes a serial killer, Deucalion will actually join forces with a couple of cops to hunt down the creature and Frankenstein.This is an interesting and intriguing take on the Frankenstein mythology. It's not Karloff and James Whale to be sure. The original monster owes much more to the original Shelly story. This monster is intelligent and thoughful and it is his creator who is the true monster. The characterizations of the monster and Freankenstein are well done and interesting. I thought it was perhaps a bit overlong and bogged down in some spots but overall I enjoyed the book.

The characters neither acted nor sounded like real people. They all talked the same way and all made long speeches with big words -- even Gacal, who I think was only about ten years old. Cambara, the protagonist, goes to Somalia to escape a horrible marriage, grieve her dead son and reclaim her family's property, which has been taken by a warlord. She shows up and right away half of Mogadishu comes to her saying, "We will help you! We will do anything you want, at risk of our lives, and you won't have to pay us! In fact, we'll even foot your bills! You can do whatever you want, no matter how strange it seems, and no one will ask you any questions! You can even go to your family property, get a plumber to make improvements, and take the warlord's pregnant girlfriend to the hospital, and she won't even inquire who the heck you are and what are you doing in her house! And then she will conveniently disappear from the story, never to be mentioned again!"After her good deed with the warlord's girlfriend, saintly Cambara pulls two random urchins off the street and basically adopts them. That I can buy, given the recent loss of her son, but I can't buy how they miraculously both turn out to be good, sweet, well-behaved boys who only needed a bath and a change of clothes to become like normal children again. This in spite of the fact that one of the boys is a child soldier and the other has been living on the streets of Mogadishu for two years.I do not understand why Nuruddin Farah is so highly regarded as an author. Perhaps his other books are better than this? I'm not going to bother to try to find out.

There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period.

Both are indispensable tools in creating a culture of performance. With its universally applicable principles and practical skills for resolving broken promises, violated expectations and bad behavior, it provides the diagnostic keys to unbundling seemingly complex issues that hold individuals, teams and organizations at a distance from their preferred futures. Beyond the welcome relief that comes from just cracking the code on a performance or relationship issue - these tools actually have the power to "knock people into gear" by making visible some of the long-term (seemingly invisible) costs associated with more typical coping or carping strategies. Without exaggeration, the skills that are suggested during a Crucial Confrontation entitled: Make it Motivating and Make it Easy can literally "change the chemistry" of the interaction to make closing the gap between what's expected and what's delivered a reality.

In the intro to the audiobook, the author describes how he abridged the book by simply skipping whole chapters. He omitted Hong Kong, Bermuda, British West Indies and the Falklands. This of course, led me to the paperback to complete the missing chapters. I'm glad I read the extra chapters, but don't think I would have missed much if I hadn't. The Hong Kong chapter is the weakest, and the most irrelevant now that it has spent a decade in the PRC. The Bermuda chapter is a little better. The West Indies chapter has nuggets of interest, though would probably need some updating (such as a volcano on Montserrat). However, it quickly jumps from Island to Island so can be a little difficult to follow. The fact that he was in the Falklands as the war was breaking out makes that the most interesting of the omitted chapters in the audiobook.As for the remainder of the audiobook, it is always nice when an author reads his own books, especially when he does it well like Simon Winchester. He has 'updated' it, primarily by reminding us that these exploits did take place a few decades ago. (I also found it useful to read the updated introduction after completing the book, helping to remind myself that these are 25 year old exploits.) The book reads as part travelogue, part history. The journey gets equal weight with the destination. I found myself with a strong interest in learning more about these places that had been nothing more than dots on the map.

Mayor is indeed a tragedy, but unlike start on another novel by Hardy. It was then a happy surprise to find that The Mayor of Casterbridge, though less famous than Tess, is an infinitely more enjoyable work.Tess, it succeeds in drawing sympathy from the reader. Thomas Hardy's irony is also much in evidence, and he comes across as quite witty. The result is a concise and interesting mixture of humor and tragedy in which characters are reasonably likable. Henchard is impetuous and comes to his end almost entirely through his own actions, but his actions are always motivated by realistic emotions and there is nothing overblown or melodramatic about his downfall. Because he is so human and flawed, it is far easier to feel sorry for him than it was for Tess, Hardy's embodiment of the perfect woman.There are, of course, elements in Hardy's style that do not change from novel to novel. His writing remains very Victorian and therefore rather ornate and longwinded. Nor is the melodrama absent from Mayor-- events often take on such an absurd turn that the reader is left momentarily with the impression of a soap opera. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, reminiscent somewhat of Dickens, and things work out so neatly and implausibly that incredulity must be firmly restrained.It is worth it, though. Beneath the superficial plot lie careful writing and hidden parallels. The elaborate Biblical Saul and David parallel with Henchard and Farfrae throughout emphasizes the unchangeability of human nature (the love/hate relationship between Henchard and Farfrae) and the cyclical rise and fall from power. Hardy also uses limited third person narration that allows the reader to know the characters and events only through their actions and conversations, further evidence of a meticulously constructed novel. In a refreshing change, Mayor moves along quickly with virtually no extraneous events.The Mayor of Casterbridge is an unusual book, and one that can be understood on multiple levels. On one, it is the simple story of the fall of a proud man; on another, it is a retold Biblical story, updated but not deprived of its original power. And though I never thought to say this about Hardy's novels, The Mayor of Casterbridge also does pretty well as entertainment...Ailanna

This is not a book that will cause controversy by laying blame on those who survived, or even more unacceptably on those who perished. This is a memoir by a woman who was qualified to be on the mountain. She raised sponsor money to make the attempt possible. She was not someone with more personal wealth than judgment that simply wrote a check for a thrill seeking adventure.Scott Fischer was an extraordinary mountaineer according to any book that I have read. He invited Lene Gammelgaard on the expedition, and also was interested in marketing his company in Europe via this woman's summit attempt. This woman was not a paid journalist; she was not the person who wanted to turn her climb into a media circus with a major American Network. If the expedition had not become a tragedy I doubt most non-climbers would even know her name. This was hardly the case with several others who were on the mountain at the same time. Lene summitted Everest, she survived the storm, she assisted others when they needed help, and she left the mountain with her body intact. One of the reasons for the last note is that she lacked the ego, or stated differently, had the good sense to talk to those who had climbed Everest, to inquire about what was most appropriate to bring, what their on the mountain experience had taught them. Far from being a sign of weakness it is an endorsement of her good judgment. Asking Anatoli Boukreev about the protection he uses for his hands on summit day is the kind of thinking that I would look for in a fellow climber. I would not want to be following those who were lugging satellite phones, computers and other nonsense to make daily appearances on national television.This is a book about her experience from well before she ever stepped on a plane to the Himalaya. It is a very personal book, and her style of writing together with her philosophies of life may not read like a thriller, however the facts of what happened in May of 1996 need no embellishment. To me these are factors that brought her to the top and back down safely. This woman is no thrill seeker, she is not deluded about what an attempt on Everest means, and she shared her experience, she did not write a book embellishing the horror of an event that requires nothing more than a statement of facts. She also refrained from taking apart the conduct of other climbers. She was not shy about expressing her opinion, however she was generally on the mark with her thoughts. And finally, far from taking the Sherpa guides for granted, she repeatedly spoke of them as critical to her success and her survival.For me, this was one of the better books I have read about that tragic May 1996 expedition.

I was about to start the c25k (couch to 5k) running program. ChiRunning techniques were a tremendous help and combined with the c25k running program, I completed my 5k training right on schedule. I've always had difficulty in pushing myself past the discomfort of running and ChiRunning helps teach focus points, relaxation, and so much more. I'm not into running for the speed or a competition race. My desire, at age 61, is just to be able to run the distance. I'm running my first 5k this weekend and I attribute ChiRunning a great deal for my success in getting this far. I was only 1/3 of the way through the borrowed book when I decided I HAD to buy my own so I could highlight and keep going back to the references!! If you're into running for the enjoyment and want to run injury free, I highly recommend the book. In past years when I tried to run, I'd always end up with shin splints and quit. No shin splints with ChiRunning!! Additionally, I ordered the book on Amazon and saved $5 from the book store price.. an my "used" copy... I couldn't even tell it had been used. It was in excellent condition. Quite a buy! It's a reference book I'll keep on my shelf and refer back to often.

I have been grateful ever since, and have tried to return the favor by giving it as a gift to others in my turn. (It's a rare and happy moment in any writer's life when she gets to give a guide to proper grammar that recipients will actually welcome with a smile.)I would never have thought that this book needed illustration; in fact, I think I would have wondered what in the world the illustrations could possibly be represent. Yet Kalman's images work with it effortlessly, perhaps because they offer a counterpoint to the prose rather than an attempt to depict it literally. I didn't see the "exuberant, rioutously colorful" quality referenced in "booklover 10's" review here on Amazon; though they are certainly colorful, the images seem more subtle than that to me, always whimsical but sometimes a bit plaintive, if also sometimes obviously funny. Much of the appeal of this particular marriage of authors and illustrator is the disjunction between the text's emphasis on detail and accuracy and Kalman's deliberately naive and simplified (yet always resonant) renderings.I guess you could say that I've had to do an about-face: hard as it was to imagine the book with illustrations before this edition, I now find it almost impossible to imagine it without them. This book also inspired me to explore some of Kalman's other work; those who enjoyed the illustrations here may also find herAnd the Pursuit of HappinessandThe Principles of Uncertaintya pleasure, as I did.

While I can't say I agree with everything in this book's approach, I can say that it helped me put &quot;pen to paper&quot; when I was &quot;stuck&quot; otherwise.There are a couple of weak points to the book. One is that King should have advised that the writers know something about supporting characters before starting to write the actual screenplay. Another is that she advocates a set pattern of writing when in reality such a formulaic method will not apply to all people.But, I still highly recommend this book as it was extremely helpful to me. I would just add a cautionary note to modify her method of writing to fit your own. Once you do that, you will become more prolific in your writing.

This book is difficult to read at first as it is written in a dialect we are not used to, however once that is established the story moves right along and the characters become familiar. I felt many of the characters were flat and not fleshed out enough. Elizabeth lacked "backbone" I wanted her to have a bit more of the spunk of her "friend". I really liked the mayor and wished that he could have just thought before he opened his mouth. Mr Hardys descriptions of the English countryside put me right there with him. A good read.

Some of the author's points are valid--the book was probably written before a lot of this material became obvious. (One of these days, I'm going to find a book that says &quot;People issues don't matter if your company's managers don't have a customer focus or your firm doesnt have the necessary IT infrastructure in place.&quot; Can't wait for that.)I worked for Lucent in the 1990s and would swear that we coined the phrase &quot;People Process and Technology.&quot; Anyway, it's been worn pretty thin. The tone of the book was a bit pedantic and stiff and so I found it a bit hard to to get through. I like Paul Greenberg's and Jill Dyche's CRM books much better, though, and would recommend them over this one, along with a new book called &quot;Why They Don't Buy&quot; by Max McKeown that is definitely the go-to book for CRM automation!

Murena Jr. "tedmurena"	3	3	2005-08-12 10:19:48+08	A Better Version Of the Tales You Will Not Find	Chaucer is an author with unusual staying power. Sure we read classical writing and appreciate it but it doesn't seem to have the impact that Chaucer's Canterbury tales still have on us. We can see ourselves and our foibles in the pilgrims he writes about and the stories he attributes to them. To think that this was written in a time period we relegate as a time period of ignorance and religion! We can imagine that even in a time where superstition ruled there were still people that that saw the world quite similarly as we do today and certainly Chaucer was among that group.This version is incredibly well translated and provides a succinct introduction including a nice brief biography of the author. Also the notes are pretty good - I just wish they were footnoted rather than all in the notes section.So if you if you think reading a work that is six hundred years old might be a little boring start in out of sequence and go right to the second tale - The Millers Tale. Like something straight out of a Jerry Springer show if this story doesn't give reason to laugh than I don't know what will. The only hang up you may have is reading in the metered format that the tales are written in. I will say that it is not difficult to get the rhythm o the words and before long you won't even notice. The book is relatively thick but it is fast reading so don't be discouraged by that - its well worth it. Reading Chaucer gives a glimpse of how the secular mind worked in the middle ages. He provides straightforward writing that isnt simple but yet isnt overly complex verbose. Without being totally austere he can tell interesting stories quickly and, since (as we all know) brevity is the essence of wit, be remarkably funny.If you are reading this for school you should be excited to know that not only are you reading a seminal work of secular English writing that is referenced throughout our culture. Also it is actually fun to read. If you are thinking about reading this just for fun you are doing the right thing I waited too long to pick this book up and but I am really glad I did it is thoroughly enjoyable and while while a little historical background may help I doubt you will need a degree in history to appreciate this one.-- Ted Murena

I just finished the last book of the STARCHILD TRILOGY by Pohl and Williamson last week. I thought the first book REEFS OF SPACE was the best.Some of the things I liked about REEFS OF SPACE:The Plan Of Man - A super-computer which runs all human affairs. Citizens must constantly check-in at computer terminals for orders ie. before beginning work, after completing each task, before leaving a room, after entering a room etc.Risks - People who have performed badly, underachieved, or been caught performing unplanned actions or having unplanned thoughts.The Collar - An explosive collar worn by the Risks which can be detonated at anytime The Plan Of Man sees fit. It also explodes automatically if tampered with.The Body Bank - If a Risk continues to screw up or underachieve there is still one way he can contribute to society by providing body parts for transplanting onto or into those citizens who need them in order to remain useful to society.The JunkMan - A man built by using body parts and made to look exactly like one of the donors at The Body Bank in order to take his place so that this donor could escape, the only person ever to do so.There was some cool scientific stuff too; jetless drive, Hoyle theory, simbiotic relationships. But all that mumbo-jumbo means little to me. Just call me Olaf Simpleton because it was the simpler concepts which I found entertaining and interesting.One thing left me cold....At one point in the story someone says that they've known several people who were sent to The Body Bank, but they've never known anyone to recieve a body part from there. Nothing else was ever mentioned about that.=============================Book II=============================The first book of THE STARCHILD TRILOGY (The Reefs Of Space) I gave four stars. This book (STARCHILD) is not quite as good as the first one. I can't give it 3-1/2 stars so I'll round up and settle with giving it four stars also.In THE REEFS OF SPACE you're shown how The Plan Of Man super-computer affects and controls every aspect of daily life for the citizens of Earth and it's colonies. You also get to experience what it's like to wear The Collar and a really good tour of The Body Bank. In STARCHILD The Collar is still a big part of the story, but only brief mention is made of The Body Bank. This second book of the trilogy also gives an up close and personal view of The Plan Of Man super-computer. You get to see how it needs human extensions of itself, humans who can be completely trusted. You're shown what it takes to become a companion of the computer; the education and training involved, the surgical modifications needed, and the sacrafice of "self" and the leaving behind of all that had been a part of your previous life, including loved ones. You also get to see what it's like to live out on the reefs as free men, out of the reach of The Plan Of Man. The climactic ending is great.If you intend reading the entire trilogy I suggest you stop after this book, I could hardly finish ROGUE STAR(the third book). You DO need to read the first book(The Reefs Of Space), but I'd say the conclusion of STARCHILD is adequate enough to wrap up the series.=============================BOOK III============================This trilogy got progressively worse for me. The first book (REEFS OF SPACE) I really liked and it was my favorite, but by the time I reached the final pages of the third book (ROGUE STAR) I didn't really know where the authors were heading with it and I really didn't care.I felt they had abandoned some earlier concepts a little too early, and perhaps could have pursued and developed other story-lines further. I hate when that happens! Abandoning one really cool concept or story-line for a lame one. I couldn't buy into that "infant star has a crush on a beautiful woman" thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It ate her boyfriend and that's why it has feelings for her. Still not sold.

Bell "A Loser Geek Like the Rest of Us"	8	9	2006-05-03 01:47:55+08	Exactly what the title says	101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men is a seminal tome in more ways than one. Well, actually, only one. It hasn't got any of the good pictures in it. But it does have 101 movies that are essential to a broad range of the gay aesthetic. It's got movies for drama queens, diva queens, show tune queens, bears, disco queens, grunge queens and size queens. The only gay subgenre it's lacking is the queer sports movie, and I'm sure once Duralde has seen Summer Storm and Guys and Balls he'll add something appropriate to Bride of 101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men he keeps promising (unless that what he's titling the lesbian companion piece he keeps promising as well, in which case he'll have to include Bend it Like Beckham or, better yet, Personal Best).When I came out, I was told I couldn't get my queer card until I'd seen Torch Song Trilogy and Murder by Death. Both are missing from 101. I'm not going to fight too hard for Murder by Death which is simply a very good example of camp and not particularly queerly significant beyond that, but I will say that I can't imagine a list of queer movies complete that doesn't include Torchsong.But what is in the book is delightful and insightful. I knew Fight Club is about the slashiest thing every made, but it didn't occur to me to put it in a list of must-see movies for the queer cognoscenti. But even the obvious choices - Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Sunset Boulevard, Valley of the Dolls, Sunday, Bloody Sunday and many more - are given new life and new perspective with plot synopsis, evaluation of what's important to the queer viewer, quotes from the movie and an interesting visual classification system.Duralde examines these movies with wit and sensitivity. He makes you want to expand your DVD library, and in some cases your VHS library, not only with the movies he lists, but with the movies he mentions in passing discussion about other movies.And, for the record, I've seen The Broken Hearts Club and it isn't nearly as awful as Duralde makes it out to be, but it is awful.I cannot remember the title or anyone who was in it, but it you're looking for a movie emblematic of what bad queer cinema is, the one with the fireman who begs his girlfriend for a threesome without specifying the gender of the third participant and then is horrified when she brings some guy from the neighborhood who's been crushing on him for years into the bedroom is the one to choose.

Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read.

Feeling is the power that makes creation possible. I have read a lot of metaphysical and spiritual books and this was a novel concept for me! However I now use it all the time and try to keep track of what thoughts I have and what I actually manifest, so that when there is something that I don't like in my inmediate reality, I just trace the originating thought and simply shift my perspective. As within, so without. The universe is a hologram and we have total power to choose our experiences. We just have to make the decision and make it so!

McCauley"	20	21	2004-04-16 11:56:13+08	How science should be written	Reading the original papers would be best, but if you don't read German then the Dover collection is the next best thing. In the paper on special relativity, the Lorentz transformations are derived via formulating and solving a first order pde, a treatment that no textbook presents (first order pdes aren't taught in math physics, in spite of the fact that every set of first order autonomous odes generates a first order pde). It took my teaching the subject to advanced undergrads in later years to realize what many others have by now noticed, namely, you don't need two postulates for special relativity. &quot;Galilean invariance&quot; is enough. The constancy of the speed of light follows from the requirement that there is no special reference frame.Einstein's presentation of GR is unsurpassed for conciseness and clarity, is a model for other researchers to follow when writing papers. Here, he introduces the famous misconception (corrected today in the better texts like Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler) that general covariance is a physical principle. Well, even the greatest minds make mistakes.Feynman wrote well, but no scientist to date has written better than Einstein.

I picked up this book because my boyfriend's mom had it lying around, and as I was flipping through it, I saw something interesting that caught my eye: I believe it was the Textbook Guide for how to win a fight, as a man. It included such amusing and sarcastic remarks such as "She makes seven good points, and you have one semi-good little point. Hold on to that one semi-good little point and bring it up whenever possible." I was laughing and reading it out loud, when my boyfriend agreed that in the heat of battle, that's pretty much what happens.So, I continued reading.I finished the book, though the first few chapters were a little difficult to get through because they were very contradictory and...just plain stupid. For example, the Dumb Fox theory says that women should pretend to be weak and docile creatures because they are still "running the show" while the man believes he's a hero. How the hell is that supposed to gain the respect she speaks of throughout the book? And how can you expect to be taken seriously when you put your foot down, as is suggested, when you've been playing the doormat by letting your man believe that you're incapabable, and yes...NEEDY?The final few chapters were where it was at for me, because they focused on bettering the reader without interacting with anybody else, i.e. taking control of your emotions, not letting a single individual consume your life, etc. The point that women are more appealing with their own interests and life aside from their significant other, which incidentally makes them more in control of themselves and THEIR OWN happiness, was duly noted.I also appreciated the sarcasm throughout, and I believe that women who have a more sassy attitude can appreciate it as well and identify with the book better. I believe that if you AREN'T a very sarcastic individual, then parts of this book seem to ask for a personality change.That leads me to my next point. I think that this book should only be read by intelligent women who can read something without picking it up for the purpose to solve their problems. The women who jump to this book, or any other for that matter, defeat the entire purpose of the book anyways before they can even start reading it, and won't get it by the end. Instead, the sarcasm seems to look a lot more like serious, helpful advice. Seriously, if you're an idiot who can't appreciate a meaning behind words in a BOOK, probably don't read this. I was the opposite and picked up the book for its humor, and gained a perspective of the point being made afterwards. I'm also capable of understanding that much of this book contradicted itself, was very demeaning towards men, sometimes demeaning towards women, and that if I were to read this book for advice, I'd be running in stupid little circles.I'll say it though...I did learn some things from this book that helped my relationship. I understand the pattern of logic a little better for why talking doesn't work as well with men as action, or a lack of, and I understand that I'm the only person responsible for my happiness, that if I'm happy with myself, all those little things that women nag over in their relationships suddenly don't seem like such a big deal.Case in point: moral of the book was good. Stand up for yourself, be responsible for your own happiness, let a man into your life as an added quality and not as a necessity, don't be afraid to be who you are. The advice between the moral was stupid. Act a certain way that may be out of character for you in order to accomplish a specific goal in a way that you wouldn't normally accomplish it, and trying to adopt it into a character trait will make you 'tha boss' of more than just yourself. OH yeah, and that being cold and callous somehow yields a different result than when men do it, which was discussed in the book as a THING TO AVOID. The sarcasm was neat and slightly demeaning/offensive at times to both genders. If you can't read satire, probably don't.Overall though, I enjoyed the read. That is all.

This book gives many techniques that can only be done in a gym, on many different machines. If you enjoy training at home, on you own equipment, you will find that many of the exercises cannot be done without specific machines. The author shows a photo of a woman doing the exercise and then gives a VERY BRIEF description of what she is doing. He never addresses proper form of the exercises or what to be sure not to do in order to achieve maximum results and prevent injury. This book also seems to be focused towards women body builders or health competitors. Aproximately every chapter has a short story on a female weight trainer and they are all competitors. This told me alot about the author's goal of the book, because he seems to think that &quot;perfect&quot; is more bulky than I think the average woman pictures herself. In the cardio chapter the author tends to take off with his vast knowlege of training, and begins to lose the reader with his terms and points that he is trying to make, without giving you some background to what he is talking about. He also is ever sure to point out all of women's short comings and why she will never be able to train at the same level as a man wether it be weights, or cardio exercise (as if that was our goal). Bottom line, this book is aimed at satisfying the more Golds Gym, die-hard iron pumping, G-I Jane type, not a woman who wants to have a sleeker, sexier, but very feminine physique.

I can think of no other pastry book that comes close in either breadth or depth. Every pastry topic is covered in detail, and most recipes work as advertised, at least in experienced hands. Like the author's other books, everything is spelled out in glorious detail, and ingredient measures are given in both weight and volume. Most important, the formulations seem battle-tested, and I approach them with far more confidence than the recipes in &quot;The Cake Bible.&quot;The pie crust recipes are outstanding, and I like the fact that the finished pies are designed to slip out of the pan so you can serve them from a cutting board. The fruit pies are innovative and an extensive table takes the guesswork out of adding starch thickeners. The puff pastry, croissant, and Danish formulas work as advertised, and they produce a final product that simply cannot be bought. [Note: The King Arthur Green Mountain Gold flour recommended for the croissants is no longer available.] The food processor-based cream puff pastry is a wonderful improvement on the classic. Of course, there are a couple of clinkers (I wouldn't make the Buttermilk Chess Pie again), but my batting average with these recipes is higher than usual.As other reviewers have noted, potential buyers should be aware that this is not a book for beginners. Pastries are among the most demanding of kitchen products to begin with, and the recipes in this book are often complex. As the author herself points out, pastry is a matter of technique. It's far easier for someone to show you how to make puff pastry than it is for a book to adequately describe it to you. In addition, yeast pastries, like croissants and Danish, take a more advanced kitchen than that required for other baked goods. Heat and humidity are principle players -- not just the ambient weather, but the fact that one moment you need a cool spot with low humidity to roll dough, and the next you need a warm spot with high humidity to rise it. That's not an easy combination to achieve in the average home kitchen.Add to these inherent difficulties the author's willingness to espouse any technique and ingredient that will enhance the product, and the result is a collection of recipes that are often challenging, even to the well initiated. Simpler pastry recipes can certainly be found, but my experience is that something is usually lost in the process. Therefore, I recommend this book highly, but with qualifications. Experienced bakers will profit, but beginners could well find these recipes, and the kitchen requirements for following them, maddeningly complex.

In regards to the dispute about the title, Ladbrooke, was just another kid. SHe had problems that she needed help with and she couldn't do it on her own. Her problems show us that problems don't go away because one has grown up. Her vulnerability gave her the innocence of one of Torey's disturbed children. well that's all I have to say.

I also got the book when it came out and I must say I'm glad I did, since the website wasn't always conveniently available when I needed to freshen up on the ideas and strategies presented in LayGuide, but I could take the book along when I travelled. Plus like most people, I prefer reading from paper as opposed to reading from the computer screen.Too bad the book is missing a lot of good info still present on the website, but I guess you can't have it all. Making the whole website into a book would probably have made the book too big and nobody wants to lug around an encyclopedia (well at least I don't). I've just printed out some of the stuff from the website that I think complements the book and I'm happy with that.The previous one-star reviewer obviously hasn't READ the book though. I do agree that the marketing for similar self-help books may often be misleading but having read this particular book I can confirm that this one actually delivers. No wait, actually, forget that, don't buy the book, the less people know the stuff in the book, the less competition for tose of us that do and the more successful we'll be with beautiful women:)

This is wonderfully informative, and leaves one with a feeling of self-empowerment and confidence. Excellent for anyone. When I decided to practice as a solitary, I gave this book to my friends and family to explain what I was doing, and to expel any negative preconceptions that they may have had. It worked like a charm.

It is a little dated, but still a fun and well-written insider's story of the workings of the U.S. Supreme Court. Woodward and Armstrong write with an "inside the beltway" politically-correct perspective which may seem a little dated today. That's one feature that stands out. When it was originally released, Jimmy Carter was just being elected President, and the Congress was 2/3 Democratic. The political battlegrounds have changed in a generation. However, judicially, not as much as you might expect. Many key issues - abortion, free expression, and the role and limits of government, e.g., - continued through Rehnquist's term as Chief and still face the Roberts court. While today's Court line-up is more conservative, the process of internal court politics is certainly similar, so this book remains useful in attempting to understand both the history of the Court when it issued so many of those decisions that still drive politicians mad today, and how the often convoluted opinions on divisive issues are formed.It also provides a little nostalgia in remembering Justices such as Potter Stewart and Thurgood Marshall. The authors capture a famous incident involving these two. When the Court of the 1970's considered an obscenity case, the Justices would retire, often en masse, to a basement screening room to take in the offending film. This was a world without home videos. Justice Stewart was infamous for his statement in an earlier case that, while he couldn't define obscenity, "I know it when I see it." Apparently, at the crucial moment (you know the word I'm avoiding) of the film, Justice Marshall would turn to Justice Stewart and proclaim: "That's it - I know it, I see it!"Anyone interested in Constitutional Law and the Supreme Court should read this book.

I am a bullfighter fan ( I am Spanish ) and in my life I have taken to bullfighting to many foreign friends, I know well their point of views about the fiesta in the beginning but when you explain what's all about and the so many rules and regulation a corrida has, and the so many things that are happening but you don't see, they absolutely enjoyed.I wanted to read this book in English because I would like to know the english vocabulary of the fiesta and how the fiesta was in 1931 that my father used to tell me, after finishing it I have to say that this is absolutely the best book about bullfighting I have ever read so far!.It is awesome how this american could achieve so vaste knowledge about this matter.I love the enthusiastic way he describes all the aspects of the fiesta,the bullfighters and their different technics,everything is here, even the two roads which existed in the age to get from Madrid to Seville.I like very much the comparision he does at the beggining of the book between wine and bullfighting.I thought I knew a lot about our national party but after reading this book I realised I was partially wrong.And what to say about the way Hemingway writes... It is absolutely phantastic, pure magic and amazing...My advice is if after reading this book you want to assist to a corrida do the possible to go with an aficionado you will enjoy the triple!!.

Back in the 70's, the Human Torch has his own, short-lived title which as I recall were just reprints of his 1960's adventures from the pages of Strange Tales. In one of these issues he battles perhaps the villain with the worst name in history, "Paste Pot Pete", an utterly laughable villain. Still, he's suitably obscure enough for my test so I hurriedly paged to the "P" section but alas...no Pete. But then I recalled that he later changed his name to the vastly superior moniker of The Trapster. I had a second chance! I turned some more pages, and there he was...The Trapster, AKA, Paste Pot Pete. The book did not let me down.The Marvel Encyclopedia is published by DK books and is simply Marvel-ous! If readers remember those old handbook to the Marvel Universe comics that the company did in the 80's, this book is like taking all of those issues and combining them all into one huge 352 page book--an ultimate resource for fans of Marvel Superhero comics. Besides being thorough, the other thing I looked for was the information being current. I'm happy to say that the editors and writers, including former Marvel Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco, have scored here as well. The book is updated to include Marvel's most recent major storylines including Avengers Disassembled and House of M, as well as the events leading up to the current Civil War storyline.The book lists over 1000 Marvel heroes and villains in alphabetical order with notes about their background and powers, notable storylines, as well as their first appearance. Minor characters like Eel, Feral, and Terminus get about a page while major characters such as Spider-man, Captain America and Wolverine warrant a full, two-page spread. Again, the book shines here in being complete and thorough. Captain America's listing takes readers from his origins in the 1940's, to his eventual thawing out in the 60's and becoming an Avenger, and right up to recent storylines like "Winter Soldier".Even long deceased characters such as Mantis and the Swordsman are included. There are a few quirks, however. While the encyclopedia does include Spider-man 2099, no other 2099 characters. Likewise, and thankfully, the New Universe and even the "Ultimate" line have been omitted. There are some other omissions that are curious such as Rom The Space Knight but in a book of this kind of undertaking, there are always going to be a few omissions and errors that pop up.The book features a gorgeous wraparound cover by Frank Cho and the interior uses art directly from the comics by a host of Marvel artists throughout the past four decades. Thumbing through the book is like looking at a photo album of old friends, as you will find characters (like Paste Pot Pete) that you have not seen in many years. The Marvel Encyclopedia is a must-have item for Marvel fans and makes for a great gift item.Reviewed by Tim Janson

It's the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future, and/or get you to start making worst-case-scenario plans in the event that "all the wheels come off at once".Especially interesting were the chapters on the history of "mainstream" and "outsider" churches in the US over the past two centuries (definitely a neglected topic, as the author points out) and the "southernization" of America. If Mr. Phillips' sterling credentials and decidedly non-left orientation aren't enough to convince you that this isn't a biased, one-sided polemic, you're probably unreachable.

JEFFREY MCMAHON "herculodge"	13	15	2006-05-14 04:13:37+08	In Defense of Style	Yagoda's thesis of this highly intelligent, generous book is that the dogma, championed by Strunk and White's Elements of Style, which shames us for having our own writing style, contradicts the joys and pleasures of writing, namely, that writers have their own individual finger-print style or voice. A writer's voice, his or her style, is the sensibility or personality giving life to the page. Yogada interviews several writers, including humorist David Barry, for the subject. Yagoda's own voice is smart and lively but never adademic. I should emphasize that the lack of academic-speak is one of the book's greatest virtues and triumphs. Here Yagoda has taken a book about the style of writing, a topic that could have easily been hijacked by some stuffy pretentious academic, but keeps the passion and accessibility on the level of a delicious pop book. Anyone interested in writing and style and literature in general should love this book.

There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings. Maybe they should be open-minded about becoming a vampire.Anyways, she's my favorite author and I love her books.

I also have a basic knowledge of Buddism (I am not a Buddist, but I understand the basic principles and have read a book or two and been to a couple of lectures).That being said when I saw this book I immediately wanted to read it. I thought it would give more body to the conclusions and parallels that I had already drawn. It didn't. In fact all it did was point out all the observations I had already made. This, of course, made me feel quite clever, but that wasn't really why I had bought the book.The writing is good and sound, but I found it to be quite elementary and very bogged down with Star Wars vocabulary (if it's too much for me it's a lot). It was almost as if the writer was trying to impress me with his knowledge of Star Wars, not gonna happen.I would recommend this for a young Star Wars fan, whose parents want them to stop reading comic books. For anyone over the age of 17 I would recommend reading a introduction to Buddism , watching the movies again, and making your own observations. You would probably enjoy it a lot more, and learn a lot more.

Now, along comes a long overdue biography, and what a volume. The timing couldn't be more right, as the US has finally put to rest most of the putrid disco backlash. In the stores are not only decent compilations of the disco music but also books like this one that reflect the reality of the subculture. Not the bandwagon that pop radio jumped on, not the Arthur-Murray style competitions, not the faux-glamour suburban nightclubs, but the real deal. Sylvester was both artist and participant in the disco culture-- singer, performance artist, club dancer. The author of this book captures Sylvester in all his complexity and drives home the important part he played in the subculture that was disco.Gamson is an academic, which means that he has been thorough in locating good sources of information. He seemed to have access to so many of the important persons and institutions that played a part in Sylvester's life. He is able to provide a well-rounded depiction of the man's personality, warts and all. He does a good job laying out the formative experiences in this colorful life, be it a mother who role-modeled an imperious love of fashion but later derided a child who followed her example, or a church community that would exploit Sylvester's temperament but denounce him for acts its other members could get away with if they kept hypocritically silent. Sylvester's complicated relationship to the gay community of 70s San Francisco is fascinating. The author does a great job bringing all the early elements around in the end of the book, showing how lasting the formative events are and how much a person can fill in the voids during adulthood.Gamson is more than an academic, however. He is also an entertaining writer and he takes in this book a great tone that fits his subject. He doesn't shy away from any aspects of the life he is depicting. The sex, the slang, the drugs, the erratic behavior, the fun, the bonds, and the subculture's differing values all sparkle like one of Sylvester's jackets. There is no stuffy ivory-tower writing here. Gamson can be as breezy in tone as Sylvester, but he doesn't pander. In fact, among the disco-oriented books that have come out over the last six years, this volume is as well-produced as that other benchmark of writing, *Last Night A DJ Saved My Life*.The 60s teen drag scene, the 1970-era Cockettes, the rock-and-blues recording phase, the disco about which Sylvester had conflicted feelings; then the Hi NRG and activism phases-- all of these are given sharp observation and each makes for vibrant reading material. Gamson covers nearly all the bases, including the way the drag-loving Sylvester was an open mark for a defrauding imposter. It was great to learn how the disco albums came about, and what the exact roles of the band, producers, and record-label suits were. The only omission I found was Sylvester's collaboration with jazzist Herbie Hancock in the 1981 album Magic Windows. Otherwise, Gamson covered all the personal, community, and musical bases.This was great reading for someone like me, familiar with both Sylvester and the 70s; I think the book would appeal to anyone with an open mind who is interested in a character who will swim against the current if he is so created.

His healing was not some show off magic trick, and irrelevant today. Jesus healing power is very much alive, and scientifically legitimate. This would be great for advancements on holistic health. The book has accurate evidence of how fostering your mental and spiritual health can bring about physical healing.Secondly, this book is good for Christian counseling too. Unfortunately there are hosts of Christian counseling programs who act anything but Chritian. Unfortunately many programs have used the whole counseling based on fear, shame and guilt to get us on the right path. All this really does is promote hatred of oneself, unnecessary anxiety, and depression. With this form of Christian counseling, we are to truly get in touch with God, and ourselves in a loving matter. Instead of fear of divine retribution, we are introduced to Gods love for us. Instead of shame for our sins, we are told to love ourselves, which motivates us to overcome our sins. We are also given a blueprint on how to work through our sufferings, not wallow in them. We understand that pain is not used as a penalty, but as a source for good.Thirdly, this also has some good tips for secular psychology. I have found with pop psychology, pain and suffering are seen as evil, and should be avoided at all costs. All this does is mask the problems, or make it impossible to get past. Too often, psychologists want to analyze the problem, and try to rationalize the whole problem, without acknowledging and working throught the pain. This book shows that it is okay to suffer, and to work through our burdens. In fact, most world religions teach redemption and maturity through our sufferings.This book offers a good middle ground for both secular and religious psychology. We dont need legalistic guilt of "Jesus paid the price for sins, now its your turn", or the hip "Come on get happy" fake psychology. We are essentially shown that Jesus came to us to enter into our sufferings, and his passion was a sign of his assistance in our sufferings.

If you are curious about possible existence of paranormal phenomenon this book gives you that place to start. Whether a skeptic,a believer,this book gives the information needed to begin simple investigations in a manner that is easy to understand. For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating. Mr Southalls book however makes you feel that doing your own investigation is within abilities. This book is not perfect, but it give an excellent starting point for the novice to begin investigating from.

I was first introduced to Sonia Choquette when a friend, knowing that I was on a journey of self discovery, gave me Sonia's book "Your Heart's Desire". The book was filled with so many incredible tools to help find and fulfill our heart's desire. 8 months after receiving the book, I attended Sonia's workshop based upon the book. Combined with the book, the workshop was a life-changing event for myself.After the workshop, I wanted to experience more of Sonia's wisdom, therefore I purchased "The Psychic Pathway". I must admit that before reading the book, I was uncomfortable with the word `psychic'. To me, psychic conjured up images of the psychic hotlines that are advertised on TV. After reading the first chapter, I realized that I was not alone when it comes to "psychic heebie-jeebies". In fact there are exercises concerning this subject in the first chapter!I have read the book and have become very much aware of my own psychic abilities (Now I am even comfortable with the word psychic!). The book puts the core of what our soul is, in terms that anyone can understand and more importantly in a perspective that we can apply to ourselves. The warmth of the author is apparent with the many personal stories that she shares throughout the book. The questions, exercises and suggestions throughout the book are helpful, informative and insightful towards tapping into our soul. The book is totally awesome and I would strongly suggest anyone on a personal journey of growth, self actualization and authentication of self read this hands on book. The book truly gives perspective on reclaiming our birthright of living life from our soul!One sidenote. When I attended the workshop, the author and her assistant displayed a warmth that made them very approachable. I have attended book signings, talked to authors and none can compare to the sincerity that Sonia and her assistant have for each individual's own journey through life!

He not only has thousands of entries in each half of the dictionary (English-Amharic, Amharic-English), he also gives extensive notes on grammatical usage, such as whether an Amharic verb takes a direct object suffix, or an indirect object suffix. The entries cover a wide variety of topics: tools, holidays, body parts, etc. There are other dictionaries available, but they are very difficult to find in most countries: Dr. Amsalu Aklilu's excellent work published in Ethiopia and Ahmed Zekaria's published in India. Kane's 2 vol. Amharic- English dictionary is too expensive for most people, and has no English-Amharic section. If you need an Amharic-English-Amharic dictionary, this is a fine book. The University of California paperback edition is much, much cheaper than the hardback Harrassowitz edition from Germany, no difference in contents.

The book is a long one, at first it's very hard to follow. The plot also gets better as you get deeper into the book. It's a good book if you want to read something over a long period of time. The story takes place in at the time of the War of the Roses and follows the book's hero Dick. This book is clearly an action book. The main character, Dick is likeable enough. In this book, Dick encounters the Black arrow, a battle, a castle and more. This isn't one of Robert Louis Stevenson's best books, but yet is respectable. The original book was written in French and translated so it's got some weird words. Maybe some people would rank it higher, I'm a young guy so I may think it's hard to follow. For me, it's just too long and difficult to follow to be a really good book. Stevenson though has got some good books out there,though, including: Treasure Island, Kidnapped and more.

'Science of the Gods' by David Ash and Peter Hewitt is a great place to begin if you're a novice in the mysterious and thought provoking universe of quantum physics. This rather slender paperback, only 192 pages in length, is simply crammed with infomative material. Such topics as resonance theory, super energy, time and space considerations, matter and the space vortex, parallel worlds and multi-layered, interconnected dimensions are intelligently discussed in an easy to understand manner. This is one of the real strengths of this book, its accessibility to the average reader.Add to that numerous and fascinating accounts of otherworldly encounters with beings from 'The Dimension of the Gods' makes this book not only informative, but highly entertaining. My personal favorite section is chapter 9 - The Return of Pan.Have Ash and Hewitt successfully reconciled science and the supernatural? Probably not, but it makes for a good read all the same. Highly Recommended!!

Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues).

I felt so let down with this book. I really expected more, such as a freeform crochet project or modular crochet. None of Stoller's projects are comparable to what crocheters are doing in Austrailia, New Zealand and the U.K. Perhaps that's why I've reverted to buying knitting books, including in German and Japanese, to translate into crochet patterns.I really hoped Ms. Stoller would help put crocheters in a new light with this book, but I guess we have to wait and see what Lily Chin's upcoming book has in store for us.

The book "If You Don't Feed The Teachers They Eat the Students" was in a line up of books to read for a book report required for my School Administration course. I chose the book on title alone, and was very grateful that the humor in the title was carried throughout the book. As a future administrator or professional development specialist, I am excited that this book has given me many options to bring to the table. I only wish that my current principal would employ several of these ideas now. I will recommend this book to every administrator I know, current or future. I am glad I had the opportunity to read such an enjoyable book. I look forward to another!

Anecdotal stories without much true insight, and CERTAINLY not the level that some of these reviewers claim. I continue to get the impression that some people suffer from being overly enamoured with the author or the concept of T4A, and thus lose sight of the fact that this book is really a lot of fluffy stuff wrapped around four lines of text. Honestly, the Four Agreements are wonderful points to live by, and I do every day. However, it seems quite bizarre to me that one would need this book (or any other) to explain what these four simple sentences mean:1) Speak your thoughts clearly2) Don't ASSume3) Don't take things personally4) Do your bestFolks, these are NOT hard things to understand, and you definitely don't need books to figure this stuff out (well, ok, maybe some of you do :-). Do yourself a favor. Print out the four points I've listed above and you'll save yourself lots of money. Peace.

Not only does this book have great recipes, but it will add ideas to your meal planning for those who are low carb eaters!I'm still impressed with all the great recipes. The dish titles are enough to make your mouth water. I don't even know how to decide what to make today, but sooner or later, I will cook every last recipe. This book offers a HUGE variety of creative recipes, with easy to find ingredients. The directions are complete and come with helpful hints - while at the same time stay low carb.This is one of my favorite cookbooks - filled with great tasting healthy meals! The recipes are uncomplicated and you will experience flavor, freshness, and seasonality of each vegetable in the dish. For vegetarians and meat-eaters - this book is a must read to cut your carbs.This book is truly useful for those that are interested in becoming vegetarians, or even vegans. It's definitely one of the first books I would recommend to those moving from meat to meatless. There are a couple of others that you could also read and gain a wealth of knowledge and recipes from:221 New Vegetarian DishesDelicious, Healthy And Easy - Tom's Vegetarian Cookbook: Easy Yummy And Nutritional Vegan RecipesThe Black Art Of Cooking: The Raw TruthThe Golden Age Vegetarian Cook BookVital Facts about Foods: Included: 200 + Longevity recipes & 250 Food Analyses ReferencesFor each of these books you can rely on, I love vegetables, and everything I have tried in these books was just great. In fact, between them all, I have really come to rely on them book not only for recipes, but for reference as well.

Weeks "Bob"	6	7	2008-06-10 13:36:11+08	If you read only one economics book, read this	This book, first published in 1946, explains common fallacies (a false or mistaken idea) that are particularly common in the field of economics and public policy. At the very start of the book Mr. Hazlitt explains:Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine -- the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for then plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.At first it seems as though not much has changed since the end of World War II. What has changed, though, is the scope of the dangers Mr. Hazlitt identifies. That's because government is much expanded and more assertive today than when this book was written. In 1946 the New Deal was not very old, and the tremendous expansion of government social programs was still in the future. We should take these lessons as even more important today.It is the overlooked consequences that cause harm. They are overlooked sometimes because they are difficult to see, as in the broken window fallacy explained by Frederic Bastiat and also in this book. They are also "overlooked" because, as Mr. Hazlitt tells us, one group wants special favors from the government, and although there is no way to grant these favors without harming some other group, the favor-seeking group will seek to hide, obfuscate, muddle, or minimize the bad effects. At the same time they promote the policy as good for everyone. This is largely the job that lobbyists perform, and billions are spent on it each year. That's because a powerful government has the ability to bestow valuable favors, those favors being paid for by someone else, someone often not easily seen.An example of overlooked secondary consequences is government spending. When government spends, it means it must tax or borrow. What government spends is not available for individuals to spend. When we see magnificent public works (say a new downtown arena in Wichita), we don't see all the things that would have been bought had the government not taxed to build the public work. We see the jobs created by the public work -- all the construction workers that will be building the new arena -- but we don't see the jobs destroyed because people had to reduce their spending elsewhere.Foreign trade is a case where people often fail to grasp the complete picture. We often see exports as something good for our economy, while imports are seen as bad. Imported things are things that American workers can't compete with, and so American jobs are lost, it is often said. But as Mr. Hazlitt says: "It is exports that pay for imports. The greater exports we have, the greater imports we must have, if we ever expect to get paid. The smaller imports we have, the smaller exports we can have. Without imports we can have no exports, for foreigners will have to funds with which to buy our goods." So those wanting restrictions on imports are also -- although they do not say this, either because they do not recognize it or it doesn't matter to them -- calling for fewer exports.In recent years we have been told that our is a "consumer-driven" economy, fueled by people tapping their home equity that accumulated from increased home values, or spending by going into debt. It is as though if consumers started saving rather then spending on immediate consumption, the American economy would collapse. But Mr. Hazlitt tells us that "saving is only another form of spending." After all, what is done with money that is saved? Today, few put their savings under the mattress. Instead, it is loaned to a bank or invested. Then it is spent on capital goods, which businesses use to increase their productive capability. The key fact is that businesses spend it. And, they spend it on capital goods that either expand their capacity to produce, or decease their present costs of production. Either way, that is good for everyone. It means more jobs, and better jobs. But this saving is derided as not being "productive."As a conclusion Mr. Hazlitt tells us:And this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than producer, are considered.To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.This is a very valuable book, which while dated a bit, cuts through the fog and haze of economics and public policy and lets us understand the effects of our government's policies.

I think that the real progress of humanity is not in technology,in scientific knowledge, in wealth or anything like that, but is in the always greater awareness that the only reason of life is LOVE. Maybe today many people think to know this, but they really don't know, 'cause love isn't just finding a man or woman to spend life with. And this book will help them understand what's really about it. And, hopefully, it will convince people who think life's purpose is somewhere else.OK, knowing is not enough, as Fromm teaches, but it's the first step, and I hope we all will do it someday...

I find it strange that some of these negative or one star reviewers stated the supposed facts they understood from the book. Did they even read it or skim along, get into an angry frenzy and decide to write a review? Their reviews couldn't be more inaccurate. Over and over again, Jax lets you know that it's not okay to be subjected to just eating the topping of something without the crust or the insides of a sandwich. She writes to be prepared, but to also express your feelings when others expect you to be ok eating contaminated food, or eating around the dangerous parts of their dishes. Although I find some of her dialogue or self-back patting to rub against my grains, I still very much enjoyed her book and will not only suggest others should read it, but hold onto it for future reference. I guess read it and research anything you find questionable since it was published in 2005, things change, facts change. Otherwise, enjoy.

Robert Creamer has written quite a bit on baseball. This may be about the best biography of its time. You can't do much better than Tom Parker if you take the audio route. I've read or listened to other works by Mr. Creamer & they are consistently good. That said he has alway seemed a bit to attached to the numbers. Baseball is the most satistical of sports & I do enjoy them. Ever year there is a new on that can be applied however unofficially to players of other eras such as the Babe. One of the newest ones now in vogue is the quality start.Six inningss minimum with three earned runs or less is a quality start. Having said that sometimes the numbers overwhelm the story. Stats on the Babe's minor league years will be forgotten about 2 seonds after you hear them. Mr Creamer endeavors to be accurate & may knock down some of the legends, or reduce them to believable proportions. The belly-ache heard round the world & The Babe hitting three home-runs in his last game are examples of the hype at the time. Creamer gets real & lifts, in the end his biography to a more adult level. I think Mr. Creamer dwells a bit more on Babe's other appetites, as well, such as women. His various ailments, injuries & suspensions have surprisingly depressed records that could have been even greater than they eventually were. Babe's juvenile behavior in his early years & the number of people in the baseball world that he irritated by his sometimes arrogant attitude through-out his career thwarted him in the thing he wanted most: to be a big league manager. That is sad & we'd have a lot more to talk about since he lived for another 10 years after he left baseball. He died relatively young but he was & still is (despite his numbers being slowlyeclipsed) the greatest. If you wanted a truthful biography this is is a pretty good one & its available in the audio version.

The flaw of the book is precisely what Chapin says it will be at the outset: he's presenting only what he saw and heard, and did not--not, that is, until the &quot;call in the critics&quot; finale of the text--attempt a broader perspective in any fashion, including by truly investigating, then or now, what was going on in rooms he wasn't in. The book might have benefited from a stronger editorial hand as well--it's irritatingly repetitive, always introducing information to the reader as if it hasn't been introduced already--but somehow it's eminently readable (I think the &quot;eminently&quot; applies only to those who come to the book with their fascination already built in).

She is obviously one who captured the summit with a trophy in mind. I also have found no evidence that Scott Fischer's expedition WAS an &quot;environmental expedition,&quot; as it has been called repeatedly. Standing this book next to Jon Krakauer's is like walking on your head, it's pointless. Lene Gammelgaard's main motive was to bag the top and become the &quot;celebrity&quot; she claimed to have become back home. Her writing, though a journal format, is childish and of amateur quality. One would hope a book about the Everest tragedy and the mountain itself, no matter who the author is, would offer a profile on the history of the region or something to make it interesting. Gammelgaard should have done some research to augment her own experience. Yet she simply punched out some weak profound sentences and came up flat. I applaud her for other life experiences and contributions to her homeland's society but as with other climbers in that fateful year, Gammelgaard has done more damage to the sport of climbing than she did good. Apparently she is working on a second book. I suggest she spare us or make it a children's book.

Since Hayward has chosen the unique vantage point of concentrating on the actions of Germany, namely the Luftwaffe, I found Hayward almost in a supporting role, and myself, disturbingly, rooting for the axis. Possibly because of the extensive use of formations, numbers, and tactical movements it became a bit dry, but as it progressed it improved. And what seemed to be inconsequential details, only added to the flavor. This book is an excellent addition to others that cover this period in history, and most notably the more colorful book, "The Battle for Stalingrad".Hayward utilizes and quotes extensively from the diaries and personal papers of key airman and military leaders. He is also not afraid to critique other works and correct false history. A good portion of the book covers the lead-up to the fight for Stalingrad. The numbers of materials and planes destroyed throughout the campaign was staggering and the Russians contempt for its own people was appalling. It was remarkable Russia held them off. But even with poor Russian leadership, it was the over extension by Hitler, the severe Russian winters, and the sheer numbers of tanks and men that would eventually lead to Germany's destruction----it was economics over military objectives. The study concludes with a critique, a summary, and an aftermath.Lord's BlessingsScott

However, being placed on the grand stage that amazon allows, requires greater care in the information that is actually put out to the world.Trinidad was discovered on Columbus' 3rd voyage to the New World and NOT his 2nd. Also, the Dutch nor French ever held control over Trinidad. It was the Spanish (who allowed French planters to own plantations via the Cedula of population) who first controlled Trinidad and then the British who wrested control in 1797. Those missteps about the history of the country whose name this book is in is a huge turnoff.Apart from that, ok recipes.

It is written like a textbook with topics addressed in logical order. This book covers detailed descriptions and analysis of many traditional chart patterns and some attendant trading strategies. Numerous examples are given in annotated charts. Technical terms are defined and explained.In the ninth edition (2007), Appendix E contains a Turtle Trading System manual written by Curtis Faith (one of Richard Dennis' original Turtles) - a dated but nevertheless instructional description of a mechanical trading system.Though this book is a great educational tool, I feel it would be a mistake to take it all literally as a guide to trading. The original author, Magee, last updated the book in 1966. He goes out on a limb regularly in his advice on how certain patterns 'typically' resolve. The probabilities with which his rules apply to today's markets would undoubtedly vary from pre-1966 markets. William J. O'Neil, in his renowned How to Make Money in Stocks (2009, p.-146), said that many patterns discussed by Edwards & Magee such as triangles, coils and pennants have, in recent times, shown to be "unreliable and risky" patterns "without sufficient time or price correction to become proper bases."I found the book a frustrating slog to get through because Magee uses a very formal, wordy and repetitive writing style. In the eighth and ninth editions professor Bassetti has added numerous editor's notes and extra chapters to the original, but frequently uses awkward, incomplete sentences to belabor the obvious. More annoying were Bassetti's repeated attempts to be clever, e.g. p.- 415: "The wild frontier of the Internet and of the gunslinger speculators. Amazon bucks on. Give us a slug of rotgut whiskey and get out the ruler", or "one might almost say awesome, if the word were not in such currency on `Saturday Night Live' and the `Comedy Channel'". This sort of running commentary gets tiring after 800 pages.

Not every one indulges in those kind of activities and we are proud to say our future son in law wouldn't dishonor our daughter in that way. The problem was that it just didn't mention it in one place but it was repeated in several areas.

I know that eventually my child will start asking questions about death, and I'd like to know what resources are available. I was particularly drawn to this title because it can be tailored to a variety of religious belief systems. I disagree with a previous poster who stated that this book teaches that there is no afterlife. The way I read it, the book doesn't take a stand either way. Being "alive" on earth is not the same thing as "eternal life" in the religions I am familiar with. No religion I know of denies that earthly bodies are alive and then they die.I like the fact that this book compares all types of organisms from plants to animals to people. The concept of a life span ties it all together. What is "in between" the beginning and ending of a life is living. I appreciate that this book emphasizes the in between, and therefore strikes a positive note.I would caution against using this book as a regular picture book for toddlers and older preschoolers because it may actually introduce the idea of death before a child is able to comprehend the explanation. However, I think it's an excellent choice for a child who is asking about death or who has recently experienced the loss of a pet, friend, or relative.

The issue and the core of the problem are so well defined and the single line of argument is being bulit step by step. People often argue on political issues without knowing what're the counterpart's assumptions, and this book offers a clear explaination of the source of the conflict. The same kind of conflict of visions actually not only exists in the US, as I was thinking about the difference btw. confucianism and Taoism in ancient China and the assumptions used by both sides (constrained and unconstrained visions) is strikingly similar to today's left and right's parties. This book leads me to think of things I've never thought about, and the clarity of thought is the hallmark of Dr. Sowell, whether you agree with him or not.

The "pedestrians have the right-of-way" attitude won't cut it out there, folks! Of course some deaths were not the result of the individuals foolishness, but also by accident or bad luck.

And economics books are usually full of a bunch of boring formulas. In college, I read two of these super boring economics textbooks, and I really didn't learn very much about economics. After college, I read this book, and I learned about twice as much by reading this book, than by going through my two boring college economics classes.This book is so easy to read. It has really interesting examples, like what's the economic benefit or detriment to an economy, if a thug tosses a brick through a shopkeeper's store window? The broken window will create jobs for the people who make new glass windows, but what does this do to the economy as a whole? Even though the book centers on this example, and examples really similar to this, it covers tons of different topics in economics.Everyone should read this book! Economics is a very important subject, and it can be really hard to get into an economics book long enough to actually learn anything. This book is totally great for a first time introduction to economics, and it's a great way of looking at things differently even if you know a lot about it.I've read the print book years ago, and I just listened to the audible edition. Both are excellent, and it was a great book to read again.Pros:+The quickest way to get you up to speed on the subject of economics+If you're interested in politics at all, you really should read this book+It might be the only readable book about economics out there, and economics is a really important subject+Still fascinating after over 70 years+Audio book reader was greatCons:-It was originally published in 1946, and then updated in 1978. So, even this most recent version is over thirty years old, so it's written in a little older language with dated examples, but for what it is, it's very good-It's a little harsh, just like all economics books are, about small groups of people who should lose their jobs so that more people can have jobs in the long run. I'd recommend a few sections on how we can help these people transition, but then that would probably make this book really long.

It is as fundamental to my writing efforts as a dictionary or thesaurus. It is so thorough and well organized, it could easily replace a stack of textbooks and be used as the basis of a high school or college English course. I have written three books, and in the final editing process I've gone through the Gregg Manual page by page, testing each rule on my manuscript, invariably finding numerous things needing correction or improvement. I have learned more about proper English from this book than from any other single source.One thing to keep in mind is that this reference manual focuses on business writing, not fiction. There are sections that don't apply to novel writers. Nevertheless, most of the information applies to all writing. This book is an easy recommendation to anyone serious about quality writing.

I have been a catechist, teaching elementary school age children for over four years. I use this book extensively in my sessions with the kids, because they listen...intently. Rather than many dumbed-down, Disneyesque versions of children's Bibles that I have seen, and rather than the somewhat lame materials offered by our church, the Children's Illustrated Bible connects with kids. It does not insult their intelligence, but enhances it. The rich liturgies of the Old and New Testaments are brought to life with vivid portraiture and detailed factual explanation. Want to know more about life in the Middle East in biblical times? It's there. Want to know what type of wood might have been used in the Ark? Or what mountain range Ararat belongs to?My students, ages 5-9, are harsh critics. When something isn't real, or interesting, or meaningful, they simply turn off. Too many of the standard cut, color and paste exercises last five minutes with them. But when I pull this book out to read the wonderful stories of Noah, Moses, the Flight from Egypt, Jesus calming the sea, and so forth - the kids listen with mouths agape. They strain their necks to see the beautiful illustrations and pictures.This Bible is an excellent gift for god-children, for nieces and nephews, for your kids. Even if you are not religious, your kids will benefit deeply from hearing and reading the wonderful tales of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and step up their cultural literacy significantly.

I think a fact that some of the US readers might have overlooked is that first and foremost Bill Bryson is a writer, an extremely funny one at that. About twenty years ago I travelled by car from the West Coast across continental USA all the way to the Eastern seaboard. Over the three months it took, I saw a dazzling array of sceneries, cultures and accents, all of which undoubtedly make the US a wonderfully fascinating place to visit. Mr Bryson may offend the sensibilities of some Americans but his portrait of small town America is savagely hilarious and often hits the target with spendid accuracy.

You really just get an academic summary of these ideas with virtually no context or elaboration.

Not only is this a little too close, thematically speaking, to the sandman series, but it is also far to heavy handed on the descriptions of the immateria. After the first paragraph on this "immateria" as Moore calls it, I had gotten the point. But it goes on and on for pages (and continues into the second, and third volmes), as if I were some dumb putz who couldn't figure it out. The series is almost insulting. However the art is absolutely stunning, especially in volume three, but that is not enough to save the series in my mind. Sure it's fun in parts, and mildly interesting as well, but all the heavy handed [stuff] about magic, and Crowely really got on my nerves after awhile. In retrospect I am very glad that Moore keeps his magic fetish out of League, and his other comics, or at least mostly out. If your into magic then this is a fantastic read, I'm sure, but if you think of magic on earth as some kind of bad joke, steer clear of this ..., it might ruin your appreciation of Moore's better comics.

I have used the original, full-sized edition with older kids for many years. It's been especially useful in helping older children who have had little exposure to church or Bible do some learning before they are baptized.Recently I ordered 4 copies of the compact edition. It turns out that the type is so small as to be almost unreadable, even for children. The body copy is printed in 7 point type--smaller than phone book text type. The type in the notes under the illustrations and photos is 5 point. This tiny typeface will discourage most children from reading, especially those that are not eager readers to begin with. It will also make it hard for parents to read with their children.I returned the copies I ordered.Rev. Susan Grant RosenCharlestown, New Hampshire

"Building Moral Intelligence" by Dr. Michele Borba is a book that every parent should read and own. In a world where there are so many negative influences on the internet, in the media, T.V. shows, magazines etc. many parents do not even realize the amount of immoral influences that our children are witnessing every single day. As parents, it is up to us to teach our children the importance of good character.

But anyone parenting or spending time with children should have a look. It helps you (or rather, it's helping me) step back and realize how subtle ways that we interact with children have lasting repercussions. For instance, how we might respond to a boy when he says "oh look, that kid over there is crying" vs. our response to a girl. Studies show that we'd steer the boy away, distract him, move on to something different. But to a girl, we encourage her to help, to be sympathetic, and engage in a discussion about what happened.Towards the end, the authors offer some suggestions on how to tap into the emotional side of our boys, how to develop modes of communication that can last through adolescent years and into adult hood. I find them useful, and hope that my husband and I are & continue to use them.

This extraordinarily insightful, easy to read book will benefit any parent or teacher of boys. As I read it the first time, I was amazed by how honestly, truthfully and succinctly it described the challenges boys face. As the father of two boys, this is my bible. It is a reminder to celebrate the spirit of young boys and watch out for ways in which that exuberance can be stifled by parents, schools and other children. Armed with the knowledge contained in this essential guide to raising boys, parents will have greatly improved their chances of having a close connection with their developing boy and ending up with a man who is emotionally whole.This book may be of most value to women because it gives them insight into the lives of boys (and men) that are not otherwise available to women. For all the love my wife feels for our sons, she -- like all women -- has no first-hand knowledge of what it is like to be a boy. Instead, she (mis)interpreted our sons' behavior in light of her experience growing up as a girl, and by comparing it to stereotypes about boy behavior. This remarkable book gives women a unique opportunity to stand in their son's shoes and see the world from their perspective.Raising Cain merits the highest recommendation.

It does not go into detail and leaves out particularly interesting passages of Bonaparte's carreer, such as some of the battles and in particular Auterlitz.As can be expected, if you have read about Napoleon before, you will be left with a sense of emptiness, as some critical and crucial events are covered in a single paragraph.The only major shortcomming of the book is that it practically ignores Napoleon's relationship with women (Josephine, Marie-Louise)which as we all know is key to understanding Napoleonic history.The book is very well documented and overall presents a very nice introduction to Napoleon.

In the beginning, it was only I who would take the time to read it. However, when we went in to see teachers during parent/teacher conferences, each one recommended this book for our three boys. Finally, my husband decided to take their opinions to heart and read the book. I was amazed that he finished and actually showed great respect for the work and in-depth details.It has helped us a great deal, not only with each son, but with each other as well. In fact, my husband pointed out that he felt the same way as some of the kids in the examples.I am very much a supporter of this incredible book and cannot say enough reasons why parents of boys should buy it and read it. If you are a mom, or a dad, who can't seem to understand why your boys are doing or saying what they do, buy this book.We also have two daughters and to be perfectly blunt, this book is not just for boys. There's often times when things will click for on the behavior of our daughters -- maybe it's because they get so much behavior habits from their brothers, two of which are step-brothers. One of the things we have enjoyed is finding out how important it is for father's to be involved the right way. This means interacting with the kids on levels that are effective for them. Also recommended: Mommy CEO. This book shares levels of importance in treating kids as individuals and fitting into their lives for a positive experience with each one. Both books are extremely reader friendly and easy to understand.

Hanson "rdhanson1"	19	20	2006-11-26 03:13:18+08	Wait Until First Grade for This One	It's hard to rate this book, because it does some things very well and other things not well at all. Our kids certainly like it more than the one we read when they were toddlers. But I recommend waiting until they are 6 or 7 until you start this one. Almost every story has some part that I don't want to explain to my 3 year old. As an example, do a Google search for the painting "The Deluge" by Gustave Dore. This painting is part of the page on the Great Flood. At what age do you want to explain to your kids about David and Bathsheba, Jacob Rachel and Leah, drawings of Herod's men killing babies, and the stoning of Stephen? When you are ready, this is a good book. Be ready.The second criticism is about how the stories are told. I can't quite describe it, but it's like the language is more removed from the action. It's a modern translation, but very stiff and formal. I consider it more formal than the NIV Bible that I normally read. It it trying to prepare kids for the King James version?On a positive note, my kids really do prefer this Bible to the one that we used before. Maybe it's because the drawings are more realistic. It uses many classic paintings that have stood the test of time. It also mixes in photographs of things that haven't changed in centuries, like using a donkey to carry heavy loads, or ancient roads.I think of this more of an encyclopedia of Bible facts, rather than a children's Bible. There's something about it that just doesn't speak to me that way other Bibles do.

Wiley and Bona have created the premier reference work on the Oscars - the complete list of nominees and victors, taking up the book's final 200 pages, is reason enough to buy it. It's the liveliest reference work you'll ever read: Each annual essay contains bite-size recollections of the impact (or lack of same) of movies big and small, at the box office and in the press, full of dishy reviews and catty responses. Each essay year has info that the most dedicated movie buff won't remember or never knew, particularly the fascinating narrations of Tinseltown Oscar campaigns. The level of detail is astonishing, down to which '90s ceremony participants did and didn't wear AIDS ribbons. Lovingly detailed descriptions of ceremony attire, highlights of speeches and host schtick - good and (much more often) bad, and follow-ups to big wins, failed campaigns and Oscar night emabarrassments never fail to fascinate. The book is more than 1,000 pages long, and once it's over, you'll be begging for more. Guys, write about 1995-99! If you have the first edition (which runs through 1987), buy the latest edition (which runs through 1994). The new essays are even more exhaustive, since the source material is contemporary, and, presumably, contains the authors' firsthand reporting. Only one quibble: In a book stuffed with deliciously nasty commentary from film reviewers, Wiley and Bona beg off from relating John Simon's &quot;too cruel&quot; criticisms of Sofia Coppola in The Godfather, Part III. Mason, Damien: You don't pull a punch anywhere else in your masterpiece. WHAT DID HE SAY?

The other two books are &#34;IMPERIAL HUBRIS" and &#34;OSAMA'S REVENGE."The main weakness of this book is the author's lack of strong criticism of Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and of other states that are corrupt, repressive, and therefore a huge part of the problem. Having said that, here are some of the key points:- &#34;West&#34; pioneered genocide, expulsions, and religious wars, with Spanish genocide of Indians in Americas, and Spanish expulsion of first the Jews and then the Muslims as critical starting points in understanding Muslim rage today- America adopted terrorism as a preferred means of fighting proxy wars in both Central America and Africa, when Reagan began &#34;rollback&#34; with the same neo-conservative advisors that guide Bush II today.- West has four dogmas as summed up by Edward Said (who is admired by the author): 1) that Orient is aberrant, undeveloped and inferior; 2) that Orient is inflexibly tied to old religions texts, unable to adapt; 3) that Orient is inflexibly uniform and unable to do nuances; and 4) Orient is either to be feared (Green or Yellow or Brown Peril) or controlled.- Fundamentalism actually started in the US among the Christians seeking to insert religion into the state's business and ultimately demanding faith and loyalty as the litmus tests for acceptance.- Earlier generations of Islamic reformists disavowed violence, but ended up adopting violence after being in state prisons (e.g. Egypt).- Earlier incarnations of a Muslim revival were in the open literature in the 1920's and then in the 1960's, and lastly in the 1980's to date--our national &#34;intelligence&#34; agencies appear to have missed the importance of all three- Viet-Nam, Africa, and Central America all fostered extremely unhealthy connections between CIA covert operations and the drug trade, with CIA routinely condoning and often actively enabling massive drug operations and related money laundering, as the &#34;price&#34; of moving forward on covert operations.- The obsession with winning the Cold War at all costs essentially destroyed U.S. foreign policy and set U.S. up as the enemy of the Third World [see Derek Leebaert's &#34;The Fifty-Year Wound"].- Morality in the US has been perverted, as the extreme right, joining with extreme Zionists, has &#34;captured&#34; the U.S. government in both Congressional and Executive terms. Orwellian &#34;spin&#34; together with the labeling of all dissent, made possible by media corporations &#34;going along&#34;, has destroyed any possibility of informed, objective, or actually moral dialog.- The Central American campaign pioneered the privatization of terrorism and proxy war by the US, with secrecy and deception of the US public being the principal role of the US government.- The US Government is explicitly accountable for introducing bio-chemical weapons into the Iraqi arsenal, and thus accountable for the genocide and war crimes attendant to their use.- US (AID) sponsored textbooks, such as those created by the University of Nebraska, routinely used terrorism against Russians as examples in the mathematic and other textbooks being distributed in Afghanistan.- CIA's main contribution to the destabilization of the world has been in its Afghan-related privatization of information about how to produce and spread violence, and its training of tens of thousands of jihad warriors from all over the world who have now returned home and are teaching and leading others.- Under US leadership, Afghanistan has gone from providing 5% of the global opium production in 1980, to 71% in 1990, and even more today--much of which comes to the US.- America not only accepts massive drug activities as part of the &#34;cost of doing business&#34;, but also ignores human rights in its rush to cozy up to corrupt dictators.- From an Iraqi point of view, the 1.5 million or so children that died in Iraq due to the sanctions, must be seen as a major war crime and a form of terrorism, together with the air war with its indiscriminate murder of thousands if not tens of thousands civilians including women and children. The US has killed more civilians in Iraq than it did in Japan with two atomic bombs. Napalm and depleted uranium are disabling US troops as well as Iraqi civilians long after their use in the field.- Economic sanctions, when they have the impact they did in Iraq, must be considered weapons of mass destruction, their application terrorism, and their results war crimes.- The US Government's general disdain for the rule of law, but the incumbent Administration's particular focus on ignoring treaties and refusing accountability (e.g. for war crimes) sets a new low standard for immoral behavior by nation-states.- The UN Secretary-General was forced by the US to ignore the Rwandan genocide because of a US desire to keep everyone focused on Sarajevo, and continues to us its veto power to prevent UN from being effective against racist Zionism, which is routinely committing crimes against humanity with its Palestinian campaign.The author concludes, without sounding inflammatory, that America was built on two monumental crimes: the genocide of the Native Americans, and the enslavement of African Americans. His point: the US is in denial over this reality, while the rest of the world is completely aware of it. He agrees with Jonathan Schell, concluding as Schell does in &#34;Unconquerable World,&#34; that the challenge of our times is in &#34;how to subdue and hold accountable the awesome power that the United States built up during the Cold War.&#34; The last sentence is quite powerful: &#34;America cannot occupy the world. It has to learn to live in it.&#34;

This book has (I believe) been in print without interruption since it was originally published in the 1940s. I myself have bought so many copies that I have lost count, replacing copies borrowed by students and never returned. Although the world that Stuart wrote about, rural Kentucky in the 1920s and 1930s, has pretty much vanished, the book, in its passion for the good of education, in its compassion for both students and teachers, feels utterly contemporary. The stories of Stuart's experiences as teacher and administrator speak to our needs, even though most of us will never have to ride horseback to school or beat a student senseless to earn classroom control or be beaten ourselves by ignorant opponents of out views. But in our different world it is good to be reminded of the power of the teacher-student bond, a bond that will not soon be eliminated by distance education. Teachers who know how to make a class come alive, how to bring learning to life, are as important today as they were sixty years ago, or indeed 600. Inspirational, insightful, theoretical, this book is all, but it has also one more virtue: the prose is a bit breathy, but Stuart really knew how to tell a story!

Aird	1	1	2007-11-20 03:06:39+08	It's a jolter	This book will hit you smack between the eye sockets as Sister Souljah describes her own upbringing in the projects, in the grips of a welfare system designed to convey feelings of inferiority, an educational system in which black children were given no reason to take pride in their colour, their origins or their past, life in college and as an activist. She discovers a class beneath the underclass where she grew up. Souljah writes of the desperation that gripped not only adults but children and the complete death of love between black folks (235). She calls welfare hotels urban hellholes where "African children were doomed. It was a recipe for extinction of my people. It was genocide." This story brings to mind an activist called Geoffrey Canada who tried to convey the urgency of the problem. Souljah nailed it beautifully. Man/woman relationships play a significant role in this story. Be prepared to be jolted out of your seat.

FROMM	"Love," says Fromm, "is the only satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence." Poets have written that, "Love conquers all," and to "surrender to it." Urging one to surrender implies resistence to Love, but why?Fromm asks, is Love an art, or is Love a pleasant sensation or feeling which to experience is a metter of chance, i.e. something one, "falls into," if one is lucky. Fromm asserts that Love is an art, and says that to truly Love, in all its forms, one must possess: Maturity; Self-Knowledge; and Courage."Object," or "faculty,": Many people pursue objects or affection, or objects to love, and correspondingly treat them as possessions. Fromm asserts that Love is the faculty or ability to Love in its different forms: brotherly love; romantic love, etc. Since Love is an art to be practiced, Fromm asserts that it can only be practiced in freedom with one another. In other words, people cannot treat others as objects or possessions to be controlled for ones own egotistical or selfish purposes. Such behavior to result in certain destruction and never to attain true Love."Love," vs. "falling in Love/Infatuation,": People speak of falling in Love, with new people they meet. Falling in Love is not necessarly Love, but infatuation, e.g., strangers meet, they break down social walls between one another, they feel close/as one. This new experience, infatuation, Fromm describes as "one of the most exhilarating and most exciting experiences in life. However, Fromm argues astutely, that this initial infatuation feeling slowly and naturally loses its miraculous character more and more with time, as the two people get more acquainted and learn more and more about eachother - flaws, character defects, etc. Fromm says the problem all-to-often arises when people confuse infatuation feelings (exhilaration/excitement) for proof of the intensity of their Love. As the infatuation feelings naturally subside, it results in the wish for a new conquest, a new "Love," with a new stranger. Again the stranger is transformed into an "intimate" person, again the experience of falling in love is exhilarating and intense, and again it slowly becomes less and less, and ends in another wish for a new conquest - a new "Love," always with the illusion that the new "Love," will be different from the earlier ones. Fromm says this is not Love. These illusions are greatly helped by the deceptive character of sexual desires. Sexual desire aims at fusion, says Fromm. It can be stimulated by the anxiety of aloneness, by the wish to conquer, by vanity, by the wish to hurt or even to destroy, as much as it can be stimulated by Love. Because most people associate sexual desire with the idea of Love, says Fromm, they are easily misled to conclude that they Love each other only when they want each other physically. Fromm asserts this is not unlike a drug addiction, when people constantly seek out the exhilaration/excitement of infatuation. Fromm cautions that if the desire for physical union is not stimulated by Love, if romantic/erotic Love is not also coupled with other forms of Love, that it will never lead to union in more than an orgiastic, transitory sense.An implication of this that when this happens, i.e., when one finds new infatuation, the other one on the losing end gets scarredm then after a few times of getting burnt will begin to actively destroy or sabotage Love in the nascent stage when it occurs in the future, in an effort to avoid the past painful feelings associated with Love gone wrong or to avoid feelings of vulnerability and/or to maintain control -- in essence to not surrender to Love.Fromm describes what he calls the essential components that need to be mastered, for all forms of Love: Care (the active concern for the life and the growth of that which we love); Responsibility (to be able, willing and ready to respond to the psychic nneds of the other); Respect (concern that the other person should grow and unfold as he/she is on their own, to be aware of her unique individuality - freedom); and Knowledge(a desire to discover what makes the other "tick," an active penetration of the other person).Fromm concludes that Love is not just a feeling, it is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise. To love means to surrender and commit without guarantees. Love is an act of utter faith says Fromm.

He further argues that under the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, "...you cannot predict future stock prices from past stock prices."However, there are also many stock traders who proclaim technical analysis not as a science for predicting the future but instead as a valuable tool to identify favorable trading opportunities and trends. The assumption is that all of the fundamental information and current market opinions are already reflected in the current price and when viewed in conjunction with past prices often reveals recurring price and volume patterns that provide clues to potential future price movement.In the foreign exchange markets, its use may be more widespread than fundamental analysis. While some isolated studies have indicated that technical trading rules might lead to consistent returns in the period prior to 1987, most academic work has focused on the nature of the anomalous position of the foreign exchange market.It is speculated that this anomaly is due to central bank intervention.

I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the "Good story teller" catagory and not a "ufooligist". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin.

If you are hesitant to believe there is such a thing as &quot;self discovery&quot; and describe such actions as &quot;selfish&quot; instead, then this book is not for you. I enjoyed reading Sue Bender's story about her insights while living with an Amish family. What began as an interest in the Amish quilts became an obsession for her. She eventually finds an Amish family in Iowa who is willing to let her stay with them for a summer as a companion for the families aging grandmother. From the very beginning what Sue notices is not so much the obvious differences in clothing, lifetstyle and religion but the way this Amish community had deeper way of just being. Timelessness or being in the moment was something they displayed with each and every activity. &quot;It was as if they had uncovered a way to be in time, to be part of time, to have a harmonious relation with time.&quot; The author comes to re-evaluate the life she has been living and asks many of the same questions we ask ourselves. There are no easy answers in this book, just observations to be read and pondered upon, to enrich and stimulate. What would be our answer to the ultimate question Ms. Bender asks of herself,&quot;Am I a successful human being and not only a success?&quot;

Hoehne "Brad Hoehne"	27	29	2002-10-14 05:33:14+08	Take a Trip with Oliver Sacks	Sometime during the writing of his well regarded book &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot;, Neurologist Oliver Sacks took a 12 day trip to state of Oaxaca (pronounced wah-HOCK-ah) in southern Mexico ostesibly for the purpose of observing and cataloging ferns with members of the American Fern Society- to which he belongs. Oaxaca Journal is the Author's first person account of the delighful little adventure that resulted.Because of the Author's boundless curiosity about pretty much everything, the trip becomes more than just a fern collecting odyssey. To the searching eye of Sacks, a simple midmorning sitting alone at a cafe table in a town square, becomes a rumination on human tolerance for sun and shadow. A visit to the Ancient Meso-American city of Monte Alban becomes an excuse to probe into the curious history of rubber- which the Zapotec people used to make their heavy sport balls for their own unique form of basketball. Casually encountered botanical names are savored for their historical baggage and contribution to language and culture. And each new plant Sacks and his travelling companions encounter sparks a conversation which could end up touching on just about any realm of human experience.Sacks' travelling companions are a particular delight; intelligent, well read, boundlessly enthusiastic, they are the sort of people one dreams of having along on trips to casually recount tidbits of history, science, and cuture to enrich the experience. Anyone belonging to a club with a scientific or academic bent, will recognize the combination of passion and quirkiness in the author's new friends.Fans of the casual, digression laden, style James Burke's &quot;Connections&quot; books or of the popular recent books on single subjects, such as Mark Pendergrast's &quot;Uncommon Grounds&quot; and Mark Kurlansky's &quot;Salt&quot;, will probably enjoy Oaxaca Journal. These books are typically pretexts for digressions into juicy and fascinating anecdotes from the nooks and crannies of human history and knowledge.In a way, the author's vivid account of his trip reads like a book length &quot;National Geographic&quot; article. There's no real agenda or underlying theme. The confluence of experiences that the trip allows to happen is point. In this sense, like the best travel writers, Sacks teaches his reader a way of traveling- that is, a way of searching and savoring our fascinating world.Oaxaca Journal is a pithy 162 pages- with a generous amount of white space included. I would have liked to have seen more text- but I suppose that that would not fit in with the brief nature of the trip in which there was enough experience to tanatalize, but not delve deeply. The entire work could be savored during a long airport layover on the way to an exotic travel destination- which I think would provide the perfect lesson for how to proceed once arrived.

I am not a vegetarian, but don't eat much meat. I like simple recipes, easy to find ingredients, a good balance of nutrition, and most of all, delicious recipes. Oh, and I really like it when just one dish fulfills all these needs and you don't need side dishes (keeping it simple). Jeanne Lemlin cookbooks all meet my criteria. Some of my favorite recipes from this particular book are: Braised White Beans with Tomatoes, Zucchini, and Garlic; Classic Vegetarian Enchiladas (actually, those are in the oven right now), cooked tomato-chipotle salsa, and the Mock Meatloaf (I made this for Christmas, along with the mushroom gravy and some mashed potatoes- I made meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers and my husband raved. The funny thing is, I HATE meatloaf made with real meat). There are many others I love, and many I haven't tried yet.

Here Hemingway shares with the reader his insights gleaned from years of intense study of the art. This book covers the terms and actions of the fight along with the author's personal evaluations of what makes a bull fighter great and what makes a great bull fight. He also explains the inner soul of the matador and how it connects to the soul of Spain. Much of the content is devoted to his own observations and the stories of individual bull fighters.I have never seen a bull fight so I started reading with a fairly neutral curiosity. I was quickly drawn into the story. At time I had trouble following the individuals, equipment and the stages involved in the bull fight, but I still found the book to be enjoyable. At the end I felt that I had a much better understanding of the lure of the bull fight and what to watch for if I would ever see one. I had no background into the history of bull fighting or those enshrined in its pantheon. To reader interested in the history and art of the bull fight, this book would probably be an indispensable tome. To me it was a very enjoyable read. Hemingway has a way of telling a story that is entertaining, word after word. Even the seemingly endless narratives of the heroes of the rings held my attention due to the skillful writing employed throughout. I ended up with an openness to attend a bull fight, if the opportunity presents itself, and questions in my own mind about how the sport has evolved since the original writing in the 1930s. Whether you are a fan of the bull fight or merely enjoy a story skillfully told, "Death In The Afternoon" is a classic to be savored.

He has had Type 1 diabetes since age 12. He is now in his late 60's, still works full-time plus, exercises hours every day, and has more energy than most people of any age, with or without diabetes.At age 35, his body was falling apart due to the ravages of blood sugar. He had signs of kidney disease and eye disease and nerve pain in his legs.Then he discovered how to normalize his blood sugars through the program in this book. Most of his complications eventually disappeared, and he has had no new complications since. His theory (shared by most diabetes experts) is that the complications are due to high blood sugars. But his solution (keeping your blood sugars in the normal range 24 hours a day) is rejected by most doctors, who believe it is too difficult for most people.The three keys to his program are: A very-low carbohydrate diet - This is the most important part and will probably be helpful even without the other parts. Bernstein prescribes NO sugars, grains, fruits, milk, or starchy vegetables (fast-acting carbs.) He does recommend relatively small amounts of green vegetables and other slow-acting carbs, because of their vitamins and other nutrients. This is not an Atkins-style, no-carb diet.Frequent blood sugar monitoring to develop your "blood glucose profile." You need to learn exactly how different foods affect your sugars, and how sugars change overnight and with exercise. By checking his blood sugars after each food he ate, Bernstein discovered how carbs raised his blood sugar faster than his injected insulin could catch up. He has you check your blood sugar many times a day.Frequent dosing with fast-acting insulin or (for Type 2s) an insulin-sensitizing pill, to cover your meals, along with a low dose of long-acting insulin to get you through the night and early morning hours. He recommends insulin even for Type 2's who make some of their own, because he believes the injected insulin will take the pressure off the pancreas and allow it to heal.If this sounds like a difficult program, you haven't heard half of it yet. He also recommends extremely vigorous, anaerobic exercise. He prefers prolonged weight or resistance training to the point of pain, because building muscle mass helps soak up blood sugar and lessens insulin resistance.His program also requires you to counts carbs and proteins and calculate your proper insulin dose before meals. He recommends you have as many as four different kinds of insulin for different occasions. He wants you to floss after every meal to prevent dental infections. And there's a lot more.But is it worth it? In researching my upcoming book, "The Politics of Diabetes," I have interviewed four people who read his book. Two thought it was too hard to try. One stayed with the program for a while and says it helped, but he has slacked off. One woman stuck with it and says it saved her life.Diabetes experts I have queried are skeptical of how much the ultra-low-carb diet helps. They cite conflicting research and the success many patients have even on a balanced diet that includes fair amounts of carbs.There is also no agreement on the need to get blood sugars down to "normal" (less than 95, say.) Many docs think getting sugars down to 120 or even 140 will be sufficient to prevent complications in most people. True, but SOME people will get complications that would not have gotten them if they kept their sugars lower.You have to have some education and a lot of self-confidence to take this on, especially as it may mean educating your doctor as well. There is a steep learning curve, and this program will probably totally take over your life for the first weeks or even months. As you get used to it, it becomes less intrusive, but still much more so than the usual programs your doctor may put you on. It comes down to how important your health is to you, how much time and money you have to devote to your diabetes care, and especially how much support you have.Bernstein is aware of these difficulties. He consistently advises lower-cost alternatives to various medications and equipment, which makes him one of the few docs or self-help writers to recognize that money is a problem for many of us. But the book is a demanding read - densely packed with valuable information on everything from insulin injection and blood glucose checking techniques to the different kinds of oral diabetes medicines, from what to do when you're vomiting (call your doctor immediately!) to pages of low-carb recipes. The language and style probably work best for people with some college education, although a determined high school graduate could handle it. It also has a number of inspiring testimonials and a good sense of humor.I think that people who are having trouble managing their diabetes might want to try this program, or at least the low-carb diet part of it. If you want to do the whole thing, this book by itself won't be enough. You will need to get the help of a doctor and probably a diabetes educator as well, and having some supportive family wouldn't hurt.If you do try it, I support that decision. I'd like to hear how you do with it.

When I was browsing the bookstore for young people's bibles, I was surprised to find that there were Catholic Bibles and Baptist Bibles. Naively, I had expected all bibles would be more or less the same except for the illustrations.The DK Bible manages to fend off internecine religious wars by having employed a cast of religious, historical and educational experts in the creation of this work. The "consultants" list on the copyright page includes two reverends, a rabbi, a sister and a father, as well as two experts from the Western Asiatic Department of the British Museum. In addition to the stories themselves, written by Selina Hastings, the introduction and section openers were written by the educational consultant, Geoffrey Marshall-Taylor. Together with the 11 editors and designers listed on the same page, these experts, the author and the illustrator have created a work that serves the several communities seeking a quality children's bible, and it serves those communities very well.This Children's Bible has many strengths and attributes:* The DK Children's Bible is fundamentally designed as a storybook. There are approximately 140 stories of two or three pages each, all of which seem to have a comprehensible beginning, middle and end (i.e., a strict story arc that may not be easily identified in the meandering source material).* The DK Children's Bible is also an attractive picture book. Each story is illustrated with at least one and as many as three illustrations by Eric Thomas. The Thomas illustrations appear to be in colored pencil, or possibly pastel or crayon, and they are generally representative and clear.* The DK Children's Bible is a primer Bible: Each of the stories are attributed to a specific books, chapters and verses of the Bible, so readers who find their interest spark can go to the original material easily. Many of the spreads include Bible-verse pullquotes. For example, the story "A Son for Zachariah" includes the following quote in the sidebar, "Fear not, Zachariah: For thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shall call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth." (Luke 1:13-14)* The DK Children's Bible is a visual historical dictionary and art history lesson. In most cases the stories are accompanied with color photographs of related people, places or things and/or with historic paintings, buildings, etchings, sculptures, architectural renderings or decorative objects that relate to the story at hand. (The introduction, for example, includes images of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John from the seventh-century Lindisfarne Gospels; "The Israelites Turn Against God" features a contemporary bronze idol of Baal; the story of "Jesus Before Pilate" includes images of Roman coins issued by Pontinus Pilate.)* The DK Children's Bible is a historical atlas. The Old and New Testament section introductions both include a two-page map of the ancient Middle East with place names labeled. This helps makes things like the distance between Nazareth and Bethlehem easily comprehensible. Smaller maps are interspersed through the text as appropriate. For example, the story of "Elijah in the Wilderness" includes a map that explains the relationship between the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah.* The DK Children's Bible is a historical reference work. In addition to the detailed introductions to the Old and New Testaments, the stories are interspersed with articles explaining the following eight topics that inform the world of the ancient Bible: The Patriarchs, Life in Egypt, Life in Canaan, Conquering Nations, Jesus of Galilee, Daily Life in Jesus' Time, The Early Church and Paul's Journeys. The various stories are also separately annotated with relevant historical facts. For example, story of "The Sermon on the Mount" includes a discussion of the Mount of Beatitudes as a probable location for Jesus' speech.* The DK Children's Bible is a biographical dictionary. At the back of the book, a four-page "Who's Who in the Bible Stories" summarizes the identities of notable Bible characters and refers the reader back to the appropriate stories. For example, "Abednego: One of Daniel's three friends. Pages 162-164."Overall, this is an outstanding book that has a place in every literate child's home.

(Newly revised and updated)Dr. Bernstein is a diabetic himself, diagnosed in 1946 at age 12. Over the years he has developed his own special way of keeping his blood sugar levels at appropriate levels, which managed to keep him healthy and from suffering many of the standard serious health problems associated with diabetes. He believes in arming patients with information to control their disease themselves. This book covers new oral medications, new insulins, and new dietary supplements. Bernstein's views differ from the American Diabetes Association, particularly in his recommendation of a low carbohydrate diet, avoidance of certain types of oral medications, and using nutrients to lower insulin resistance.This very complete book includes some patient stories, chapters on the basics, tests, how and when to measure blood sugar, treatments, diet, weight loss, exercise, insulin information, and recipes. There is an excellent glossary and an index, in addition to useful appendices. Well written and easy to understand, it is over 500 pages of useful information.Some important and surprising statistics:-- 25% of Americans between age 65 and 74 are Type 2 diabetics.-- One in three babies born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes during their lifetimes.-- Every day 1,400 people are diagnosed with diabetes.-- It is third leading cause of death (and contributes to high blood pressure, heart disease, infections, that also are factors in deaths).Armchair Interviews says: It is very important to know about this disease.

Makes one even sadder to ponder that Kelly's own autobiography was lost when his house burned down in the 80's. That would have been a helluva read.

Does it have any value for the more dispassionate?Considering how politically charged the terrain Mamdani covers is, he'd have been wise to stake out a clear path and illuminate it brightly.Instead, he wanders all over the place. There are several slap-dash historical comparisons and conceptual distinctions whose significance and relevance (if any) are often left unstated. Some seem to be mere tangents or academic exercises. The book is poorly organized and inconsistently documented (sometimes it's thorough, sometimes not).Still, Mamdani has some points to make and, despite strenuous efforts, he doesn't completely succeed in obscuring them. These points are generally the kind that reasonably open-minded people could or should have figured out for themselves, so they're more like "reminders" than "insights":- Muslims aren't all alike, and Islam isn't just one thing.- The distinction between "culture" and "politics" is both necessary and problematic.- Adversaries are sometimes more similar to each other than they like to admit.There's more to it than that, but it's that kind of stuff he's really out to discuss. As a source of such "reminders", then, I suppose the book has some value.But it was annoying to read.

While I was in middle school I checked the book out numerous times. I loved the book. I loved Cleo, I loved her story and her strength. I even knew the exact location of that book and what the hardcover picture looked like. Move on in time to high school and college and every so often I would scour for the book (the title of which I had forgotten but I knew the authors last name began with an 'M'.) So finally after finishing college I went back to my old town and asked to go into the junior high library. I found the book. On the same shelf, same location and with me being the last person to have checked it out.

Bagnolo "Slugger/BIGGUY"	2	2	2010-05-22 11:57:39+08	BEST BABE RUTH BOOK EVER	Before I readBabe: The Legend Comes to LifeI was already convinced by everyone I ever knew who saw him play, that no one, perhaps other than Ted Williams was even close to being his equal. Creamer created a work of art in this book. He takes us through the Babe's childhood, and after reading that, one has to wonder how George Herman Ruth turned out so well. However, once Creamer describes the Babe's career, personal life and incredible athletic ability, one begins to speculate what further heights he would have reached had he played today.Despite his incredible career, Ruth faced some personal difficulties which he buried in a sea of sexual encounters with women of various backgrounds, in his eating and drinking habits; he ate in huge waves of hot dogs, steaks, chops, ribs, desserts, and washed them all down with soda pop, beer and much stronger liquid refreshments. He slept very little and still out hit and out pitched any and everyone in the game for all time. And what the slanderers leveled against his clumsiness, were just that, slanders. Ruth was one of the finest outfielders in baseball and he could steal bases when younger and run bases intelligently with the best of them right up until a few years before his retirement. Moreover, his celebrated paunch, was all but eliminated between1924 and 1927, because of the diet and conditioning he began and his wife oversaw, and did not return until 1933, two years before his last game.His love for children, and his affection for the down and out, and for his pals was immeasurable. He was a wonderfully empathetic man, despite his practical jokes and and seeming reckless abandon at times.Creamer has put together such a work of genius, that I read it twice.There is one other set of factors not covered in the book which I want to present in the Babe's favor: In the Babe's era, the minimum height of the pitcher's mound was 15 inches, but many teams had it at 18 inches; today it is 10 inches. In Ruth's day the average center field fence was 450 feet from home plate today it is 405 feet a 45 foot difference and in the POLO GROUNDS, where the Yankees played before building Yankee Stadium the center field fence was 490 feet from home plate. The alley's were 30 to 40 feet deeper in the Babe's day than now and the baseball? The baseball differential between the liveliness then and the liveliness in the period from 1996-2006 was a joke, today's baseball is considerably livelier. Several computer studies by academics in consultation with physicians, have shown that Ruth would have nearly doubled his home run output in today' era. Many of the studies showed Ruth hitting anywhere from 950-1250 home runs had he started his career in 1988 and played to 2010.God gave us one Jesus, one Michael Angelo, one FDR and one Babe Ruth. Nothing more needs be said.

Gary Null has dozens of other books teaching you step by step how to be healthy and tons of advice for specific illnesses, but that information is not available in this book. Why? There is a simple reason for that. This is a COOKBOOK!! It starts out with juice and shake recipes and then it continues with other recipes using your juicer. There is a section for breakfast foods, soups, salads, dressings, sauces, dips and spreads, main dishes and desserts. Most of the recipes I have tried so far have been incredibly delicious. I said most because I did not like the Carob Fruit Bars, they were too sweet for my taste and too moist, as for the Almond Butter Cookies, the batter was too dry and grainy and did not form into dough but the taste was good, it just needed more liquid. As for the great tasting recipes, let me start with my mom's favorite, the Fruit and Nut Cookies ... she can't believe they are made without sugar, dairy or eggs! The dates were difficult to use at first, but now I chop them in tiny little pieces and they're a lot easier to use. The Date Fudge Brownies taste great with the Cocoa Coconut Frosting and Heavenly Roasted Nuts and because I'm Vegan, I used Maple Syrup in the recipes instead of honey with excellent results, and besides, I've never liked the taste of honey in baking. The Carrot Walnut Cake is out of this world. The Classic Vegetable Stock is the best I've ever made as well as the Spicy Texas Chilly and Lentil Burgers, and I could go on and on and on! Oh, did I mention the Creamsicle and Mango Fruit Pops? Yum!! As for my non-vegetarian friends and family, I have cooked the Salmon with Teriyaki Sauce and the Swordfish with Basil Oil and have been subject to rave reviews!! I have to admit that I've used this little recipe book more than any other recipe book in my collection. The ingredients can be easily found in any regular supermarket and for vegans, certain ingredients can be easily converted with wonderful results, except for the fish of course, but then again, most of us have to cook for other people in our lives who are not vegetarian so that works out perfectly.Enjoy this book, it's one of the best!

This book is a brilliant scholarly study by a fine professional historian. This is important because much of the attraction of witchcraft or paganism, both to its adherents and to the wider society as a whole is that it appeals to deep intutions and fears about history and the past. Whatever happened to the pre-Christian religions of Europe? Are there people who consciously worship the Devil? Is there a continuous history of pagan religion that has lasted to the present day? What were the deep roots behind the savagery of the witch trials?It is one of the invaluable merits of this book that Hutton answers these questions, which are, respectively, it died out, no, no, and not misogyny. Hutton shows considerable sympathy to the modern witches and pagans. Without them, after all he would not have been able to write this book. Yet Hutton is quite thorough that their main belief, that they are reviving a pre-Christian past that in some way or another is superior to Christianity and to our modern society, is false. "...the unique significance of pagan witchcraft to history is that it is the only religion which England has ever given the world."Some historical context is needed, and Hutton provides it throughout the book. In the 1920s Margaret Murray came out with the thesis that the witchcraft trials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were actually directed against a real religion, an organized Pagan religion which was the common religion of Europe that underlay a superficial Christianity. Associated with this view and slowly developing later was that the witchcraft trials were savagely misogynist attacks against women. This view has been the backbone of pagan propaganda for decades and it is only now changing because it is increasingly clear that it is untrue in every major respect. To argue that there were really witch ceremonies, Murray deliberately excluded all the supernatural elements in the trial testimony, making it look more sober and rational (and non-coerced by torture) than it really was. Contrary to myth, 9 million women were not burned, but only 50,000 people in total. A majority were women (though in some areas of Europe most were men), but contrary to myth, midwives were not specifically singled out (indeed they helped to look for suspects), and many of the poor isolated people accused were themselves denounced by women. The idea that people were only superficially Christian is clearly inaccurate as scholars such as Christopher Haigh and Eamon Duffy have shown the strength of Roman Catholicism before the Reformation and its hegemony (scholars have also shown that the oral-literate distinction has been much overstated in modern England.) Hutton is quite good on how folklorists saw customs that clearly developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be pagan revivials. He points out how the distinguished archaeologist of the Baltic, Marija Gimbutas, became so obsessed with the idea of a Pan-European Goddess religion that she ignored that the supposedly "Goddess" English superhenges were actually a thousand years later than the supposedly "patriarchal" Irish Linkardsdtown cists that supposedly replaced them.But Hutton is more than a debunker. The first half of the book goes into detail about the wider cultural influences that encouraged a revival of Paganism in 19th and 20th century Britain. He discusses as part of the decline of Anglicanism how even rather stalwart figures like Kipling and H. Rider Haggard looked to something more exotic. He discusses the enthusiasm for Pan and the belief in a primoridal Goddess. There is a very useful chapter on the origins of freemasonry, which should be read by all those who believe the myth that Jack the Ripper was somehow involved with the Prince of Wales. He also provides a chapter on cunning magic and low magic (were cunning men and white magic representatives of a pagan religion. Short answer: No. In fact they were just as religious (or no more religious)as the wider society.This covers the first half of the book, and the second half covers the second half as an actual neo-pagan religion developed. Although many witches and pagans today emphasize their feminism and environmentalism, leading pagans like Aleister Crowley and Gerald Gardner were actually tories. (The one truly unforgiveable thing about Crowley in fact was his anti-semitism.) Although Hutton shows commendable patience and tolerance with his informants he does show that there is no evidence of a continous pagan religion. Indeed, there is little reliable evidence that any witches can date back their practices before the second world war. Gibbon once wickedly commented that one reason that Romans believed that Christians were guilty of preposterous crimes like incest and cannibalism was because Christian sects so often flung such accusations at each other. Hutton notes the same problems about modern witches, though he clearly points out that there is no evidence they were guilty of anything (promiscuity isn't even mandatory!) criminal. He is also properly sympathetic to those who were foully libelled and their lives damaged by irresponsible and malicious press campaigns.One interesting point that Hutton does not fully emphasize is that both the interest in paganism and the paranoid fear of Satanism is both the product of the decline of Christianity. After all, before the Enlightenment Christians did not fear an organized conspiracy of Satanists. Either they feared other Christians (Protestants vs. Catholic vs. Orthodox) or they feared Islam. More could be said also about neo-paganism and the one really existing pre-Christian religion, Judaism. But otherwise this is a fascinating book and in the end Hutton points out that modern witchcraft is not a sect or a cult or a New Age Movement or a nature religion. Personally, I think we would all be better off reading Adorno.

So as all these Marvel movies come out I am one who wants the back story or information on where the story goes next. Where does someone like me turn in these times of crisis with 30 plus years of comics to catch up on? To the Marvel Encyclopedia of course. There are great looking pictures and descriptions for each character or group and the bigger the character or group the more pictures and information on back story is available. It is impossible to get all those years of comics into one book for sure but this is a great place to start for someone who isn't sure where to start but has a new interest. I highly recommend for those of you who like Marvel comics. The product did it's job for me I'm now hooked on reading comic books.

The basic idea really is that you avoid a striding form and relax most of your body except your core so that you move forward largely by leaning into your run and coming down on your mid-foot while falling forward. This description doesn't do the technique justice, but this type of running really is designed to be both efficient and low-impact. It works well for my 50-year old body (I used it to complete the Boston Marathon as a "non-qualified" runner raising funds for a Boston charity) and allows me to get through races feeling tired but not overlyl stressed or pained. I know some fast (2:30 marathoners) who say chi running has allowed them to maintain a fast pace without feeling beat up for days afterward.The first edition of this book laid out chi running in a pretty straightforward way, while the second edition adds about 50-60 pages. A good part of the earlier edition has been repeated, but the second edition has, I feel, really expanded on the first edition by offering more information and advice on the "how to" of chi running. There is a nice new central section appropriately called "How to Learn Chi Running" that takes you through a set of step-by-step lessons that are easy to follow and making it very clear what the components of techniques are and more important to integrate them. Reading this edition along side the first edition, I found that this one is easier to follow and leaves less uncertainty in how to run.The tone of the book remains informal and conversational, and it generally provides a complete guide to topics related to running, including training, injury prevention (a real plus of chi running is that it easier on the body than traditional running form), and nutrition.Chi running may not be for everyone but I feel it is worth checking out - I suspect even if you don't adopt the whole technique, parts of it may help your running. For example, the book suggests shin splits are caused by running with the feet splayed outward. As my introduction to chi running, I tried running with my feet parallel as suggested in the book and ran a 10K without trouble when previously even running a mile left my shins sore.I highly recommend this book and feel this edition adds to what was presented in the first edition.Enjoy!

If you are only looking for the latest and hottest indicator, this book is not for you. It does have a small chapter with definitions of some recent (i.e. less than 30 years old) oscillators, but it mostly discusses area patterns like gaps and head and shoulders (the first edition was written in late forties). On the other hand, it's amazing how timeless the simple (in a Zen sense) market wisdom and insight is. Like &quot;Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator&quot;, this book gives you more than a new spreadsheet formula -- it gives you deeper understanding of the nature of the Market.On the other hand, I think you shouldn't use this book as your first TA course -- you'll probably wish to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. The book's subtle points will be lost on you, while you'll be angered and frustrated by anachronisms. On the other hand, if you know the TA basics and are looking for refining your understanding, the same old charts and anachronisms (i.e. calling Dow Jones Transportation Index &quot;Rails&quot;) can be a welcome way to gain some insight into the history of subject, while enjoying the timeless wisdom of the founding fathers of Technical Analysis.

Agreed.However, try this on for size: I'm learning to play the piano and I can attribute that directly to this book. I found this book more accessible than three other piano books I checked out in my library; the pace and organization are just right; and there's a helpful accompanying CD that lets one measure up to "the real thing."I've had very little musical experience in my life, but thanks to this book I can play quite a few songs after only a month and a half and I'm confident that I'm on the road to being a pretty darn decent pianist. Assuredly, I expect that at some point I'll need a real human being to steer me along, but at this point there's no need to spend $30-$40 an hour to learn musical fundamentals that can easily be obtained in a book.I can confidently recommend this book.

Truly comedic, though the humor early on bothered me. And sure enough, I eventually learned why.As it happens to be, Learning to Bow is a deeply rooted custom that demands the `utmost' respect, where humor interferes. I wasn't able to grasp the full understanding of what I was feeling until the near end of the book when the graduating children began practicing the bow to perfection. As Feiler too observes, learning to bow is "far more than a mere social greeting: it is the prime ingredient in the syntax of Japanese life."Awareness increased, I truly enjoyed this book. Feiler does a fine job presenting a clear picture of his experiences; from the bath to the cast, to the detailed discipline students receive, to the iron watch of their mothers, and how the students received his visit. I did observe however, how similar the fundamental `undercarriage' of Japanese values as it pertains to stressing a higher education, are to customs in America. True, the methods employed to teach children differ, but hovering pressures on stressing education and continuing on to college and beyond are similar. My favorite treats where I enjoyed the deepest laugh was coming by the question on naming the real estate company... `Up River, was it!?!' Too funny. And without a shred of doubt it took a lot to get up off the floor after reading Sato and Ishikawa's expose on `the way of love'. Absolutely a keepsake. The `Team Teaching' plan I thought, too, was a nice touch-up. Just an overall very interesting read Learning to Bow is. The title speaks volumes!

It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.

There are only a few of the chapters with any redeemable characteristics, but by no means is this book anything close to resembling something fit for human consumption, unless perhaps you are doing an anthropological study on 20th and 21st century mass-delusion.Chapter V: Taxes Discourage ProductionThe vast majority of this book is as fallacious and absurd as the propaganda promoted in this chapter. If I were to write a review of this book in its entirety, while illustrating each and every fallacy, the review would be longer than the book itself; so necessarily, I'll focus on a single argument in Chapter 5, perhaps the shortest chapter in the book.In this chapter he promulgates the quintessential argument of the modern day Republicans/Libertarians: that lowering taxes promotes jobs. Hazlitt mentions specifically personal and corporate income taxes. I could disprove this argument historically, but that will require more content than disproving it analytically, as follows.Hazlitt alludes to a number in saying: "A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions" without ever specifying a number or a guideline that could determine what that number should be. A few sentences later he says "But the larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment." There are numerous problems with this sentence but we'll focus on just one: presently many mega-corporations pay 0% or near 0% corporate taxes. Hazlitt argues in the previous sentence that there are "essential government functions" yet an increase from a 0% tax rate would be a "deterrent to private production". These two ideals are at such odds with each other that any level of taxation, or lack thereof, can be justified in any degree. To be timely with Hazlitt's own lifetime, let us consider a 48% (war-time) corporate tax rate from the previous example; now how do we decide which of these arguments apply? What is an essential government function? How do you validate that a company was going to use that money for production and not for enriching the CEO and upper management? This is vague on purpose, and this and other similar arguments have been used to reduce corporate taxes down to nothing on the mega-corporations, while we are left holding the bag.He then steps into briefly discussing personal income taxes. I'm not the hugest fan of income taxes in the way they presently exist, I think that they are a method by which unscrupulous politicians basically buy patronage from the voters with their own money, and an elimination of them (at the lower end) would perhaps cause a more nuanced and vigorous discussion of what creates prosperity among the general populace; as opposed to the voters allowing any trespass as long as the elected promise to lower taxes. Yet I can see the lack of justification that Hazlitt has for removing them, and the benefit to society when they are applied in a progressive fashion. That is presently not at all what we have at all in our system, and if they were re-implemented as originally intended with the middle class paying very little and it starting to go up at the upper-middle class levels then it would radically change the dialogue, and quality of life, in the country.First Hazlitt argues that high income taxes discourage work, but he's wrong in the following, critical, scenario.1) Imagine if there was one person in the company that effectively got to choose how much he was paid? If you were given this opportunity, how much would you pay yourself? The allocator of resources in a company (capital investment, money, labor) is primarily the CEO. The CEO has to go through the board in order to approve his wages, but in our modern world with our modern laws and systems of corporate governance this is little more than a formality in many major Fortune 500 companies. But if the CEO wanted to try to convince the board to give him a substantial raise that would make him pay 90% of it in income taxes, the board would have little incentive to let him, and more importantly he would have little incentive in pursuing it himself. This is a multi-causal problem to which having a very high progressive income tax can do much in stopping the abuse of. So what happens to that extra money that would have gone into the pockets of the CEO and upper management if prevented by tax policy? Well, if we look at history, that money was reinvested into the company and it lifted the general people's standard of living as a function of economic growth. If the pay is effectively `capped' in this manner, perhaps the CEO and other `higher ups' will (and should) receive a higher compensation for the importance of their work, in the form of company stocks. This will also encourage them to aim for the long term growth of the company, rather than looting it intentionally or as a by-product of "short-termism" and then diving out with a golden parachute, as is so commonplace today. Economic growth is much higher if there is the maximum amount of reinvestment; this is what the very high progressive income tax promotes. In this system, value creation is rewarded (long term growth) and short-termism and `looting' is discouraged.Hazlitt also argues that reinvestment is discouraged by "high levels of taxation".2) Assume the CEO got the money in the above scenario (not hard to do, since we live in a world now that has very low income tax rates on this form of abuse). Now what does he do with it? Does he start a new startup company? Not likely at all, after working for a company enough to get a CEO position why start over as a 'small timer' again? Why do anything but perform your tenure at the company you're CEO at and then retire? Entrepreneurs start businesses; people that make a bunch of money in the stock market don't, people that are existing CEO's don't, people that come from dynastic families of great wealth don't, at least they don't in any greater observable proportion than the general populace. I would suggest that they are much less likely to become an entrepreneur of a new company - for those of you unaware: the primary point of becoming rich is that you no longer have to work - a novel concept. If you want evidence of this please look at Fortune 500 and who founded them and what their background was, if this 'theory' that the rich create jobs and by extension taxing the rich destroys jobs was correct you'd at least expect to see a larger proportional amount of the "a priori rich" in these roles. In summation: A.) People with ideas and the moxy to see them to fruition start businesses, not those with incredible sums of money. B.) Newly founded businesses typically borrow from banks and are self financed by-in-large over the private investor to which lower income taxes benefit.I know personally a handful of people that make 6 figure salaries a year and they work incredibly hard for that money, and I consider that they truly earned it, and that they are paying too much in taxes at present. And yet their income has a "reality-check" as what they are paid reflects a `market price' for their services. No such "market-check" or "sanity-check" exists for the upper management of many of these mega-corps; this is the problem that is smoke-screened behind arguments furthered by Hazlitt's book and his modern contemporaries.So in this scenario, high income taxes that are progressively applied encourage production. This flies in the face of all Libertarian and "right wing" (whatever that fake dichotomy means anymore) ideology, yet it is what is observed. There is no ideological "general rule", as promoted by Hazlitt, that you can use to presuppose the outcome of a specific tax without looking at the specifics. But Hazlitt doesn't want you look at specifics, he is training you to be a reactionary. There are some useful things in this book - as there are in nearly all books. Yet, if a book, such as this one, is about 95% garbage and 5% useful analysis; I'd tell you that there are better places to pan for gold than in an open sewer.Be mindful that, in this book, in a chapter this small, there are many more fallacies that Hazlitt packs in that I must leave aside for the sake of brevity.One of the primary reasons justifying these methods of taxation that has hitherto been unmentioned, is if they are progressively implemented, they can prevent the scenario that we are living right now - a political establishment that has been bought with this ill-gotten money. By a willful chiseling away of our laws on taxation, it has empowered a new class of dynastic robber-barons in our modern era.

Specifically, most Muslims are good Muslims in that they are peaceful law-abiding citizens. But there are also bad Muslims, and these are the ones to look out for. Similar statements have existed in American history with regard to blacks, Native Americans, civil rights protesters, unionists, and any one else not in power. In all cases, the truth of the matter is that the powers that be have/are screwing over a group of people not in power (blacks, Muslims, Native Americans) and one day, some members in the latter group (Black Panthers, Al Qaeda, Chief Crazy Horse) finally decide to strike back. This book is about one group of people; Al Qaeda and other Bad Muslims; and why they have declared war on America.In short, the author takes the reader on a short trip through Middle East and related history, and the West's involvement in it. This includes America's overthrow of Iran's president in the 1950's, the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the first Gulf War, and of course, America's involvement in Afghanistan during the 1980's, and subsequent disenvoment during the 1990's.From this history, the author paints a sordid picture of how American governments and American corporations have created Al Qaeda and other Bad Muslism. First, America undermined democracy in the Middle East by publicly and privately supporting dictators as long as said dictator kept the oil spigot open and kept the communists out. Second, during the Afghan War, America encouraged its Muslim and Arab friends to send their crazies to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. Most of our friends were either secular Muslims, and/or Westernized Muslims, so they sent over those they feared the most; the fundamentalist "bad" Muslims. Third, these "bad" Muslims did not die as supposed to in Afghanistan. Instead, they got training, skills, weaponry, and most important, they got connected with each other and formed a leadership with Osama Bin Laden as the titular head. Last, these "bad" Muslims came home as underground heroes, and have proceeded to take on issues that their home governments have ignored. This includes local corruption, Western influences within the local culture, and Western influence over their local government. As a result, many of these "bad" Muslims have decided to declare war on America and all we hold dear.In all, this book is very good, and worthy reading for any American. It is in the same line as previous works such as Dust of Empire, Clash of Fundamentalisms, and stuff by Noam Chomsky, except the writing is cleaner and faster to get through.Great read overall.

White's "Elements of Style" as we attempted to reacquaint ourselves with the rules of the road when it comes to writing clear prose. Its compact size (only 105 pages) and clear organization made the tome the pinnacle of usability before such factors came into play as successful criteria for any easy-to-use reference manual. The book, at least White's famous revision of it, is as old as me, both of us born in 1959, and clearly both of us are in need of an overhaul to refresh the knowledge we present to a more contemporary audience.Enter artist Maira Kalman, who was so inspired by the book when she discovered it at a yard sale four years ago that she applied her considerable artistic gift and contributed 59 colorful illustrations to this version. The net result is a charming and comical addendum to an established classic. Keep in mind that the original intention of the authors was simply to present eight elementary rules of usage, ten elementary principles of composition and a list of commonly misused words or expressions. Consequently, it's impressive how Kalman is able to stay true to the rigidity of the book's structure with her whimsical images. Even though in earlier days I actually preferred the slap of the ruler of White's terse instructional style, I think Kalman brings a sense of humanity that is totally unexpected.

A reader writes: "However, Mr. Sulloway's book is tightly reasoned and supported by a great deal of research."You might want to look at the discussion of Sulloway's work in Judith Harris' recent _No Two Alike_, pp 92-112. According to that account, Sulloway's work was never published in a peer reviewed journal, the book in which it was published failed to provide the sort of information needed for other people to check the truth of his results, and Sulloway repeatedly refused requests for such data--for instance, the names of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs whose birth order rankings he offers as evidence, or cites to the studies whose results he claims to summarize.When someone wrote a critical article pointing out evidence that his factual assertions about the data were false, he delayed the publication for several years by the threat of lawsuits.Judging by her previous book, Harris is a careful writer, so absent some evidence to the contrary my current conclusion is that Sulloway is a fraud.

I absolutely love this book. It remains at the top of my list for books on the Craft. It is actually the 1st book I recomend to any & all newcomers to Witchcraft that I meet. Ms. Cabot gives a great deal of information in a concise, easy to understand way on "Traditional Witchcraft" from her perspective and many years of study & practice. She shows how Witchcraft, from her point of view, is an ancient Art, Science & Religion that has been much misunderstood by the masses for many years. She teaches aspects of The Art to the reader, not readably found in other books on the subject. Her section on Alpha alone makes this book a must have for any Witch not familiar with the technique. She gives an excellent overview of various Craft practices, and instructs the reader in how to apply what they are reading, to their everyday life. Power of The Witch is not just a book to be read (a great read though it is), this is very much a book of practical application to obtain desired results. It will teach the student practices that they will use throughout their life, to great benefit. I personally use (and teach), these same methods that I learned from this book,with excellent results. I highly recommend this book, as well as all of Ms. Cabot's books,to anyone interested in exploring the depths of Witchcraft. Laurie Cabot is a long standing Craft Elder who knows her Craft well. She is an excellent Teacher as her books will attest. She has founded her own Tradition of Witchcraft and for many years she has educated the public at large about the misconceptions many have about Witches. This Lady deserves the utmost respect from all of us. She has dedicated her life to The Craft & to the service of The Goddess. She is a Witch that has put herself on the line time & time again, long before Witchcraft went "mainstream". She has been (and remains), a vocal advocate for our civil rights & freedoms when no one else would speak out for us. She has worked tirelessly to gain Witchcraft the recognition & respect it deserves. Laurie Cabot should be honoured by all within the various Traditions of The Craft for the great Elder,High Priestess,Teacher & Witch that she is, and for all the wonderful work she has done. She truly is a Daughter of The Goddess, and I for one, hope to see more of her wonderful teachings released in print. Five stars simply isn't enough for this great book, if you have not read it yet, I encourage you to do so.

There's only a little action right near the end, the focus is definitely on what is, essentially, a giant game of chess between the CIA and the KGB, with agents trying to outwit and outthink one another.Although there could be a little confusion at times (the translations from Russian weren't always clear, and two similar characters share the same name), I certainly didn't see any evidence of anti-Semitism as was claimed.

Once again in this play Ibsen sets his conflict up beautifully. His main character Dr. Stockmann is realistically created, and opposed ironically by his brother the mayor. The fun truly begins when we get to watch the two brothers fight-one on the side of the public good, the other on the side of personal morality. Throughout the entire book, you question what makes each character tick, and the reading was really an enjoyable experience.

Popular author/illustrator Anthony Browne has garnered enough accolades to fill many a shelf: the international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the Kurt Moschler Award three times, and the Kate Greenaway Medal twice. We are reminded of how richly deserved these honors are with "Gorilla," a warmly satisfying story of the bond between a young girl and an animal.Gorillas are the love of Hannah's life and her heart's desire is to see a real one. Regrettably, her father is either too tied up or too weary to take her to the zoo. When Hannah asked him a question, his usual reply was, "Not now. I'm busy. Maybe tomorrow."But, did you know that surprises can take place on a birthday? Hannah had asked her father for a gorilla and, sure enough, he gave her one but it was only a toy. She tossed it aside and fell fast asleep.She was awakened in the middle of the night by a smiling gorilla who invited her to go to the zoo. She wasn't at all frightened, and eagerly joined him. That was just the beginning of their nocturnal adventure.It was a wonderful night that Hannah will never forget, nor will young readers soon forget this happy, imaginative tale.- Gail Cooke

Bernabo	13	14	2005-04-24 03:49:14+08	Ibsen on the conflict between idealism and practicality	Henrik Ibsen is the father of modern drama and his 1882 drama "An Enemy of the People" ("En folkefiende") was one of his more controversial works. In the play Dr. Stockmann discovers that the new baths built in his town are infected with a deadly disease that requires they should be closed until they can be repaired. However, the mayor of the town (the Burgomaster), who is Stockmann's brother Peter, rejects the report and refuses to close the baths because it will bring about the financial ruin of the town. When Dr. Stockmann tries to make his case to the people of the town, the mayor counters by pointing out how expensive it would be to repair the baths and dismisses the doctor for having wild, fanciful ideas. At the public meeting Dr. Stockmann is declared "an enemy of the people" by the Burgomaster.To really appreciate this particular Ibsen play you have to look at it in the context of his previous dramas, because they all represent a conflict between the playwright and his critics. In 1879 Ibsen's play "A Doll's House" ("Et dukkehjem") was produced, wherein the character of Nora pretends to be a silly little wife in order to flatter her husband, who is revealed to be a hypocritical fraud. The idea that a woman would leave her husband and children was seen as being outrageous and basically obscene. Ibsen upset his audience and critics even more in his next play, "Ghosts" ("Gengangere"), an 1881 drama that again attacks conventional morality and hypocrisy. The topic is of congenital venereal disease but the true subject is moral contamination. Mrs. Alving has buried her husband, a degenerate who has left behind a son dying from syphilis and an illegitimate daughter who is probably going to end up being a prostitute. The play ends with Mrs. Alving having to decide if she should poison her son to put him out of his misery or let his agonies persist.Again, Ibsen was attacked for outraging conventional morality. The following year after "Ghosts" the playwright responded with "An Enemy of the People" and the character that is most identified with representing Ibsen on stage in Dr. Stockmann. The allegory is quite plain when the play is considered within the context of Ibsen's work during this period, although while Stockmann is portrayed as a victim there is a sense of destructiveness to his behavior. At the end of the play Stockman has decided to leave the town, but then changes his mind to stay and fight for those things he believes are right.As is the case with most of Ibsen's classic works, "An Enemy of the People" speaks to larger issues than those in conflict in the play. The debate is over the bad water pipes at the new baths, but the true conflict is over the clash of private and public morality. Dr. Stockmann is by far the most idealistic of Ibsen's characters, and that fact that he is opposed by his own brother, the Burgomaster, harkens back to Genesis and the fight between Cain and Able. As was the case with "Ghosts," there is an ambiguous ending where what happens next can be seen as going either way given your own inclinations as a member of the audience.Both of the Stockman brothers are flawed. Dr. Stockman's idealism is at odds with the practical realities of the world in which he lives while the Burgomaster ignores ethical concerns. Ultimately, Ibsen is not forcing us to choose between the two but rather to reject both in terms of some middle ground. The Burgomaster is certainly old school, believing those in authority get to make all the decisions and that the people must subordinate themselves to the society. But he was the one who made the mistake of putting the new water pipes in the wrong place, so even his claims that he is looking out for the welfare of the community are dishonest. Dr. Stockman argues for individual freedom and the right of free expression, but his attempt to fix the problem ignores any effort at persuasion or building public support. He also seems to take pleasure in be able to show that his brother made a mistake. Still, in the end we have to favor the doctor over the mayor because his integrity is clearly stronger, while still recognizing that his idealism is tragically flawed.

If you love character in your novels, you will love Potok and this book. It provides a look inside a very insular community during a particularly difficult time: the Depression that occurred shortly after many of them arrived in America to take refuge from pogroms in Europe; the nascent emergence of the state of Israel; and the Nazi holocaust. It's a coming of age story for the main character, for America, and for the Jewish community.But the Kindle edition: oh, my. There must be 500 missing periods in the book. The word "life" twice appears as Ufe, and there are a number of other typos that seem to be the result of using OCR scanning to bring the book to an e-Book audience. It is readable, but you do sometimes have to backtrack to supply the missing periods. It's great to have older, wonderful books available electronically. I would like to hope the publishers will eventually take the time to honor the e-Book versions with adequate copy-editing. But I won't hold my breath.

Foreseeing its approach, I would want to put the whole novel aside, but morbid fascination led me to continue reading. That's the way it is with thrillers. At least most of the disasters befell the main character, a loathsome individual who, unfortunately, reminded me very much of someone in my own life.

Waid, a talented and prolific writer, simply doesn't do much of anything with this retelling of Superman's origins. The redesign of Krypton is superfluous, as is the de-aging of the Kents. The mid-80s reimagining of Superman had its faults, but it also had a lot of character; twenty years later we're stuck with a new origin that could just as easily have been of any other superhero. Clark has very little character, except for his continuous feelings of displacement, and he seems to only to adopt his superhero identity as a way of fitting in (he ends up with dual roles, one as a distanced protector, and the other as an unremarkable Everyman--are either of these really fulfilling?). Also, the opening bits of Clark pursuing both heroics and journalism in Africa smack of political "relevance."Luthor's insertion into Smallville seems to just be a nod to the TV show, and it unfortunately appears to have erased a violent and dramatic character who rose to corporate power through some very dark means. The "Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography" TPB was a great noir-ish reinvention of what had previously been a nutty and ostensibly evil scientist. Waid tries to make him a brilliant scientist who attempts to prove the existence of alien life while at the same time retaining the business suit. It doesn't quite work. You can see Waid explain his changes in the back of this collection.Unfortunately, Superman is a character that has been used and reused more times than King Arthur, and he's wearing thin. Also unfortunately, he's DC Comic's highest seller, and there's something just vaguely mythic enough about him that people keep coming back to a well that's creatively dry, both in the comics and in film. They would do better to recreate Superman entirely, to take a risk and start again from the ground-up. They made a half-hearted attempt at doing this in the 80s, and a quarter-hearted attempt with "Birthright." For instance, try making Superman the last in a line of alien knights, who follows a code of chivalry among the relatively weak Earthlings even though he's lost from his homeland. This would retain the moral core of the character, and also many of the mythic undertones.But please, let Jimmy Olsen rest in peace.

I think she needs to stop paying attention to the folks who so eagerly want to claim her as the late twentieth-century's answer to the American tendency to love the unknown writer late discovered in his or her life, a la Dickinson, Clampitt, etc.

Fedota	3	3	2009-01-21 16:41:16+08	Appreciating the Spectacle of Death	This book is a treatise on the appreciation of a bullfight; Hemingway's guide on how to become an aficionado. In addition to the excellent text, the book includes pictures, a glossary and commentary from those who have attended. One wonders how many bullfights over how many years were attended by Hemingway in compiling both a snapshot of the history of bullfighting at the time (1930s) and a full discussion of the intricacies of a bullfight that determine the quality of the performance.As someone who has never seen nor read about bullfights, the detail laid out within was both captivating and compelling. The book starts at the beginning laying out the places where bullfighting can be seen, the organization and tradition of bullfighting in Spain, the physical layout of the ring, the breeding of bulls, the training and evolution of matadors and ultimately the phases of the fight itself. While reading the passages I found myself both not believing what was actually being done to the bull and wondering why the toreros put themselves in the ring at all given the risk. This duality of both cruelty and bravery is the kernel of what makes bullfighting so compelling to not only the Spanish but the millions who attend each year. It makes this book a page-turner, despite the odd, and in my mind, useless intra-chapter dialogues between author and non-descript "old woman". Hemingway builds on this basic draw to the spectacle, evolving the sensibility of the aficionado to both the science and art of the bullfight and the dependence of greatness on the two primary protagonists. One cannot have a good bullfight with a mediocre bull, nor can one expect a great fight with an ill-trained and less courageous matador. Through the final stage of the fight, bull and matador connect on the nexus of death. The punishment preset on the bull before the introduction of the matador is not always effective and matadors suffer repeated horrific injuries from the bull and sometimes death. In nearly every case however, as so perfectly described by Hemingway, the 3-4 year old colossal fighting bull dies. A methodical ballet of spears and capes wears down the bull through three stages of the fight until he can be impaled through the shoulders with the sword of the matador ending his life in the ring that he was bred for. Death in the Afternoon provides a dramatic and thorough description of this tradition penned by a master hand.

Many people argue the flies look &quot;too good&quot; in this book to be real. But I have to say if you want a book that not only gives _the_ most complete history of the flies within, but a book that gives a _clear_ picture of what the fly should look like, then look no further. I had the opportunity to meet with author/illustrator Chris Mann in Cheltenham, England March 2002. I sat with him as he illustrated a fly for one of his upcoming books. The flies are illustrated with every detail involved and constructed on screen as you would tie them: every hair, every thread wrap, every fiber, every shadow and every hue is represented just as Chris sees the fly in his studio. And, I have to say the flies he received are just as perfect as his drawings, no kidding. So, if you start with perfect flies, you get perfect drawings. To top it off, an evening's dinner with Chris reveals that he clearly has more historical fly fishing and fly tying knowledge in his head than he could ever write; what you get in the book is just the tip of the iceberg. The book's four-color printing and richness in history and fishing style recommendations make this an invaluable source for the global salmon and steelhead angler. I certainly look forward to his future three books in this four book series.

Why? Because it debunks the myth that effective improvement programs, for most of their projects, need to include lots of high-level statistics, but rather should involve tools that anyone in the organization can use. Further, The Six Sigma Way brings out in the open the need for and value in the non &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; approach to improvement--every company, every group within a company is different, and an effective approach for each is going to vary somewhat. Finally, it was just fun reading! Examples and case studies were effective in bringing home the concepts in an interesting way, and often humorous as well. Don't miss out on this jewel!

And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a "heavy" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.Still, not an easy recommendation.

Fromm is less good at offering a realistic vision of healthy love. But even if his superego seems a bit harsh to our contemporary psyches, his vision is essential: love must not be based on sadomasochistic fantasy but on two separate realities that come together for mutual enhancement.

However, that book did not have enough practical ideas or skills to guide me decode our old agreements/emotional garbage, how to be aware and how to transform. This book has a practical guide to teach us how to live in the four agreements. It teaches us how to become aware and how to transform.1. Bring the Awareness to Surface so We Can Let Go of the Parasites, the Old Agreement, the Judge, the Victim, the fear2. How to transform by the second attention (become aware and not act on or judge too fast), action-reaction, attach-detachDon Miguel Ruiz has a very playful style of writing when he was telling us the above skills. I think in essence, the above skills suggests us to slow down our thinking process to give us enough time to steer our feelings and actions to apply the four agreements and to enjoy life intensely within the moment. His dialogue about the four agreements and other people&iexcl;s stories about applying the four agreements give me hope that I can live my life with what he has suggested. The dialogue helps us to decode certain emotional garbage and the dialogue helps me to break the old agreements. It is definitely a must-read if you have read the four agreements. Again, reading is not enough. However, putting the new adopted philosophies into everyday&iexcl;s life is the way to turn the dream of hell to become the dream of heaven.

I just finished my first screenplay (currently rewriting it) and I can honestly say that everything she says in this book is TRUE! This book is more a confidence builder and motivator than anything else -- it tells you to get up off your ass and JUST DO IT! She also tells you to use your day job to write your script--which is what I did, I actually wrote my script in my free time on the job! That way you can use your job to better yourself and pay your bills at the same time! (she advises you to use your company's Xerox machine to copy scripts--it gives you a reason for being on a job you hate!) I started out writing a page a day--the point of the story is, you DO have time to write--you just have to use spare minutes within your day to do it. She also helps you understand that self-doubt is normal, especially on the first script, so she recommends that you surround yourself with supportive friends and family--I couldn't have gotten through my first script without the support of a few friends who believed in me.She's been there and done that, and it's amazing how good she is at shoring up your self-confidence.

It was not so easy to understand the theoretical part in contrast to the practical interpretation of dreams. It was so interesting that I could interpret the symbols of dreams. However it is different between the understanding and the assurance. I thought his assertion was false in spite of the logical coherence. All psychopathic phenomena derive from the suppression of the sexual desires! How foolish! For a rural young boy it seemed that &quot;Love&quot; by Standhal was more realistic. In a few weeks, I shut out the content of this book from my brain because I took it serious. This effect was too pessimistic to interpret the human being.This book shows two important results. At first, the psychopathic is understandable if the unconsciousness exists. At second, the neuroses disappear if the unconscious sexual desires are made conscious. These findings will help the understanding of the later psychoanalysis and psychiatry.As the unconsciousness is one of the most important discoveries in the 20th century, this book should be read.

Incredibly succinct and well written presentations of concepts that are much maligned and misunderstood by wanna-be socialist &quot;economics experts&quot; every day, especially up here in Canada.I would concur that there might be some counter arguments to some of this material, but EVERYONE should at least understand the basic arguments for neo-classical economics and against socialist intervention in the economy before they embrace left-wing views, and nowhere is &quot;right-wing&quot; economic theory more passionately (and humanely) presented and defended than here.

When he revived he found himself back on earth, separated from Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium and his beloved. Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman. Knowing that it was originally published as a serial is useful because Burroughs loads on the cliffhangers throughout the novel. When Carter returns to Barsoom a decade has passed and he finds himself in that part of the planet that the natives consider to be &quot;heaven,&quot; which proves to be a more ironic idea. Carter has to reunite with his friend the fierce green warrior Tars Tarkas, fight with the great white apes of Barsoom and plant men, violate some significant religious taboos, survive the affections of an evil goddess, help with a slave revolt, fight in an arena, and still save Dejah Thoris in the middle of a giant air battle between the red, green, black and white people of Barsoom.&quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; is an early Burroughs novel, which means it is high on action and low on details. ERB would set his adventures in strange worlds such as Barsoom, Venus, Pellucidar, etc., but beyond the basic idea of it being a strange world he was content for such places to be the settings for this stories. The writing is a bit stilted and ERB likes to mix cliches and ponderous phrases that make the narrative seem dated, but &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; meets his basic criteria of providing a ripping yarn for his readers. The best thing you can say about this novel is that the action never stops from start to finish. The worst thing you can say about it is that Burroughs puts off reuniting our hero with his beloved, but if you have read many of ERB's novels, Tarzan or otherwise, you know that once his happy couple is back together the story is pretty much over. However, even at the end there is another cliffhanger that will make you track down &quot;The Warlord of Mars,&quot; the next installment in what is clearly the best Burroughs series. ERB milked the Tarzan character dry and still produced another dozen novels in that series, while the Mars books (sorry, the Barsoom series) remained relatively fresh.

However, I think the best thing about this book is how it provides that information for those who did not know, but also provides different perspectives from those who were around for the various eras.* Most SNL information, like the repeats on E! and Comedy Central, tend to focus only on the pre-1980 and post-1984 years, with Michaels at the helm. It was interesting to hear information about what the show was like during the other periods.* In particular, I liked hearing from the people that aren't regularly heard from on the subject and perhaps did not have the best fit with the format: Harry Shearer, Janeane Garofalo, Tim Kazurinski, Chris Elliott. Their words provided a refreshing change of pace from the &quot;hallowed institution&quot; language one most often hears.* &quot;Different perspectives&quot; are also expressed when recalling SNL's legendary &quot;[white] boy's club&quot; mentality. You will be quite curious as to how the same situation was read differently by each individual (and surprised as to who was &quot;for&quot; and &quot;against&quot;). In my opinion, that is the reason to buy this book - everything else you know already.

I am on the Left of the American political spectrum, an unrepentant liberal. I am also an admirer of Howard Dean, both before and after the Democratic primary, but I agree with Paul Berman that President Bush is absolutely correct about the seriousness of the terrorist threat -- and he is right to identify a key source of that threat with all fundamentalisms and fanaticisms, political or religious, wherever they arise. In recent years, the threat has come primarily from Islamic fundamentalists, but we have our share of fanatics as well.Neither one of us is a great admirer of all aspects of the President's policies, yet we cannot claim that Mr. Bush is wrong about EVERYTHING, only some things. He may be wrong about tax cuts, perhaps, but he sure is right about the gravity of the terrorist menace.This is a well-written and shrewd assessment of Mr. Bush and the problem of terrorism -- which should be required reading for liberals, who are too often blinded by considerations of "political correctness" and fail to admit what is staring them in the face: Terrorism in our world is evil and it is coming, primarily, from a small number of people in the world who are unwilling to compromise.Terrorism will require drastic action from the free world to crush it; and it will not be a pleasant or fun experience waging this war upon international terror that is hurting everyone, including many good and decent Muslims who also wish for peace for their children -- a war in which intelligence services will play a crucial role and in which, right-wingers should note this, civil liberties must be protected.Berman's recent book about the intellectual legacy of the sixties and even his introduction years ago to the collection of materials on the debate over political correctness with respect to the academic curriculum, "Debating P.C.," are excellent too.My advice: Read everything by this guy.

For anyone interested in German campaign history this book is compulsory reading !!

I've always enjoyed Bill Bryson's writing before; "A Short History of Nearly Everything" is one of my favorites of all time, and I've enjoyed the excerpts that I've read of "A Walk In The Woods", which I'll get around to finishing one of these days. So I was quite disappointed to find that I didn't really enjoy this book, especially because it's so hard to put my finger on exactly why; there are still fascinating tidbits of information thrown into the middle of more or less unrelated discussions, and he has the same facility for a clever turn of phrase that I've enjoyed elsewhere. And many of the things he says in this book could easily have come out of the mouth of Dave Barry, and if they had, I'd almost certainly have been rolling on the floor laughing; when Bryson says them, they come across as petty and snide rather than amusingly exaggerated. This, in spite of the fact that I can't put my finger on any particular difference in how they would word things. Granted, I was frequently reading excerpts to my wife because of a particularly amusing turn of phrase or interesting piece of trivia, but overall, I just found myself rather annoyed by this pretentious snob who had so little good to say about small-town America; this despite the fact that I am as big an elitist as the next well-educated city boy. I can't explain it, but somehow, the book just rang somewhat off-key. One specific I can name that explains a bit of my reaction is that Bryson seems to want things both ways; if a place is a popular destination, he complains about how touristy it is, but if it's off the beaten track, he complains about the lack of civilized amenities.

I gave this book one star because the author, in the beginning of the book, gives me useful information about the signs of having a gifted child. That is one of the reasons I bought the book and some of the information was useful.Now, on to the rest... Upon reading this material, I found it to be a self pat on the back from the author on her impressive portfolio of wealthy clients. I found plenty of information if I were an extremely rich person living in a community where the schools for the gifted were plentiful. All of her clients were fabulously well to do and their children were profoundedly gifted. So what about the rest of us? My husband is gainfully employed and I am a student. We have a modest income and our son is gifted. We found little practical advice for ordinary working parents. If you gross less than $200,000 a year, I would try another book.

It's hit or miss with Mr. Sowell, but that is the nature with most things. That aside, I think some of his books (such as Black Rednecks...) are compelling and useful debate-fuel, this one falls flat. Like anyone adhering to a specific political mindset (and he does - his brilliance is that he can conceal it well, though I would question his objectivity) he believes himself to be right - it's indicated in word usage whenever he touches on the "traditional" left/right debate, etc. The basic premise is, astoundingly, a reiteration of the title. Ideological Origins of Political Struggles? It sounds like a desperately pretentious college paper written by an undergrad looking for Political Science recognition. Imagine that politics - which, if you believe Hanna Arendt's thesis on the subject as outlined in On Revolution, is the process of human interaction and debate - has ideological origins? Astounding, truly. I could have never put that sort of logic together on my own. You'll have to pardon my sarcasm - the book is well written and thoughtful - but it told me something I already knew. I've seen a lot of Sowell's work in lists that are "vital" to every US citizen, but after reading this, my opinion of him is lessened somewhat.

I have ready many Koontz books and sometimes felt the endings of the books lacked in some way. As I was browsing through an airport bookstore, I saw this book and decided to pick it up. Boy, am I glad I did! This is one of the better books I have read in a long time.The writing style and language grab you from the very beginning and don't let go until the last page. The characters are all very well developed and Koontz actually has you caring for them when you are only a few pages into the book.The thing I really like about this book is that it isn't just the normal story of good vs. evil. The "good guys" have some bad in them that they are trying to overcome and many of the "bad guys" have some good in them also.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.

It has made me realize that I must have a plan for my life, and that I can't just be a "wandering generality," as Mr. Ziglar says in his book.I picked this book up from my mom. I was going through a really hard time at the beginning of the year this year, and she brought this book in, along with "How to Win Friends and Influence People," by Dale Carnegie, for me. I read the Carnegie book first, and found that I really liked his. My problems at the time were mainly social, and since the title of his book had to do with friends, it was natural for me to pick up. I shied away from Mr. Ziglar's book at first because my mom told me it was about success, and I didn't want some cheesy-sounding book to read about that.When I finally picked it up, I realized that it was glued to my hands. I couldn't let go of it. I kept turning page after page, gulping down every bit of wisdom that Mr. Ziglar threw at me. Then I decided to go through it a second time, and take notes.This is my recommendation if you are going to read this book: get two highlighters, of different colors each. With one color, highlight every bit of useful information you find in there, such as tidbits of wisdom. With the other color, highlight the steps to things that Mr. Ziglar tells you to do. After you get through the book the first time, go through it a second, and organize your information according to each step to success (self-image, your relationship with others, goals, attitude, ect.). Then you will have a plan.I love this book. There are so many people in my life that could benefit from it. My hope is that the life skills I've learned from reading this book will help me tremendously.Read it.

Along the way he took great photos showing the details of each step. The illustrations are excellent. A great feature of this book is that it systematically takes you through the entire fitting-out process.Like all books, this one is limited in how much information it can pack into one volume. Completing a yacht interior usually involves applying the skills of a cabinetmaker, electrician, plumber, upholsterer, etc., and while this book shows you what's involved, you'll need other materials if you're not experienced in each of these areas. Surprisingly, all of the work is done with hand tools and a limited number of portable power tools (and, I guess, a lot of patience...). Stationary woodworking machines such as tablesaw, bandsaw, and sanders would save considerable labor.My biggest criticism has to do with the translation. The book was originally written in German, and translated in the UK. As such, much of the terminology and product names are unfamiliar in North America. For this reason you'll want to refer to other sources. But, if you're considering building or rebuilding a boat interior, books are going to be your least expense.

Swiniarski isn't more well-known or more prolific I'll never understand, but after reading &quot;Raven&quot; I've come to realize that he is truly a great talent. Literature these days is oversaturated with vampire books, many of which simply cheap knockoffs of past ideas and concepts given little to make it different or original. With &quot;Raven,&quot; Swiniarski has created a new type of vampire story, giving us some familiar concepts, but infusing them with some new blood (so to speak) and creating an atmosphere that is as cold as the winter in which this story takes place.The story is about a former policeman turned P.I. who finds missing children, named Kane Tyler. He's somehow lost his memory and slowly learns that his wife was murdered and he was hired by a crime boss to locate his missing daughter. He also finds out gradually that he's suffered something more than memory loss...he's become a vampire. He discovers that those responsible for his transformation are also the ones behind the kidnapping and his wife's murder...or are they? Between trying to protect his own daughter, trying to finish his job, and trying to pick up the shattered pieces of his own life, Kane Tyler's case becomes more than a simple kidnapping.Swiniarski's sense of detail is very vivid. Very drawn out, but without rambling on about trivialities or boring the reader to death with insignificant factoids. He gets right to the point and gives us exactly what we need to know. There is a good combination of comedy, drama, and action, and his writing style is impressive in that it allows you to form a picture of what is happening. As I read the book, I could actually SEE the images in my head. I could see Kane Tyler, I could see what he was doing, I could see the action taking place. Books are supposed to do that, but rarely can one form so clear a picture in the mind, and this book does that. It's that well-written. Good story, good characters, good dialogue...it's good. It's very good. &quot;Raven&quot; is an excellent book that makes for an exciting read for anybody into a good mystery, good horror, or good action. It's one of the best vampire books I've ever read, and it's one that I keep coming back to. If you can find a copy...give it a read. You won't be disappointed.

I've lost count of the number of books I've read in the past 16 years on educating children. Some books were worth my time, many were not. Mr. Bennett's book is standing tall at the top of my list of &quot;best reads&quot;. I'm sure we all have horror stories coming out of our kids' education (i.e., the huge amount of wasted time in the classroom, the lack of control in the class, the political correctness of revisionist history), but this book really can help. Mr. Bennett begins by explaining the importance of a solid education that engages a child's imagination by first making sure that child can read well. He builds on that by reminding parents that the main responsibility for educating our kids rests on our shoulders, not the school's. The book goes into detail about more than the Three R's, but covers those subjects extremely well, also. He reminds us that as parents it's up to us to speak up and go to bat for our kids throughout their education thus insuring they get the help they need. Throughout the book are checklists, questions to ask your child's teachers, book lists for you to insure that your child reads what is truly worthy of his time, and tips for incorporating the arts into your child's life. This book is like having a one-on-one conversation with a great educator who will give you the confidence you need to take control of your child's education. Help your child succeed by reading this book and then putting it into practice!

It makes the book even better that all the stories come from the heart's and soul's of other teenagers so we can relate to them.

I have read numerous Bible story books with my ds (age 7) over the years. We probably own ten different ones, easily. Most have cartoonish pictures and repeat the same stories with the same basic parts of the story (leaving out lots of details). We read Egermeier's last year, and we are more than half way through it a second time. He just absolutely loves it. It was not unusual at all for him to beg me to keep reading!Egermeier's has almost all the Bible stories there are (with a very few exceptions). Those stories that ds had heard many times before often included details he hadn't heard before. It made the Bible come alive for him. Any Bible story book that leaves the children begging for more is a winner in my book! It was enjoyable to me to read it as well.I would highly recommend it to any one who wants to move on to something meatier than your run of the mill cartoonish Bible story book for children. I also think it is worth reading through for a second time. It is definitely a keeper!

After the race my body basically broke down. I had intense shin splints, knee pain, joint pain, etc. I could no longer even run a mile and a half without having to stop. I have been completely frustrated because running is one of my great joys and is something that I do to clear my head. A couple weeks ago my friend did an interview with Danny Dreyer and she was kind enough to let me borrow her copy of The Chi of Running and I read it right away. I was enthralled by the book and it gave me renewed hope and I have been incorporating the priniciples as much as possible. I must say it has been a bit of a struggle with the technique because I have always been a heavy foot plodder thus my injuries. But last week I went on a run and incorporated as much as I could and I ran eight miles and felt so strong at the end I couldn't believe it! I felt I could have easily ran a couple more miles. I still am experiencing pain wth my legs but I truly believe that if I follow the principles of the Chi of Running then one day I will be injury free!

After slogging my way up to the middle of the book, my level of interest experienced a whiteout worthy of winter in Antarctica. I realized, as I laid the book momentarily aside, that the reading was getting pretty tedious. A bad sign, usually meaning a book is targeted for the pile heading for the used book store.Most of this book comes across as journalizing that never got the attention of a re-write before heading off to the publisher. The lack of cohesion that should be glueing this narrative together is palpable; this is a narrative devoid of any sustaining "pull". Terra Incognita is a muddle through a pastiche of the historical events of Antarctica although it is interspersed with some pretty decent reportage of current life at the bottom of the world.Still, there ain't much to redeem the tediousness of this book except Wheeler's wry British humour. But even that's not enough to keep one's attention from freezing to death. Wheeler is encamped with predomitably groups of scientists; as such, this isn't much of a travelogue but rather a logbook of how to hang out with the transients.I think Sara Wheeler is worthy of producing some real decent travel writing; Travels in a Thin Country bears testimony to this. Terra Incognita, however, is a big hiccup; hopefully she will produce a better read the next book that comes our way.Extracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner

It does teach the basics, but there are other books out there that do it a lot better. I'm a good looking guy, and I'm pretty decent at picking up women. I have read books like this in the past, because I feel it is important to always try to better yourself in all areas of life. I also think it is important to recognize seduction techniques and utitilize them to your advantage for not only picking up women but in your career and other aspects of life. The Lay Guide is for people that have absolutely no clue or experience. I just don't like the way the book is written and some of the lines he tells his readers to use on women are so cheesey and corney that I would never consider using them. The best lines are the ones that come off the top of your head and are witty. As you build confidence, you will become more witty. Its a step by step process. The book does have some good points but there are other books that are written so much better! If you need help in this category look up The Game and Rules of the game by Neil Strauss. Also, the art of seduction by Robert Greene gives much better advice and examples.

The creatures of the night are confined to areas like You Bet Your Life park that contains condos, shops, and a supernaturally charged force field that keep vampires within. Synthetic blood satiates the hunger, but Joaquin Santiago, former master of the city, can cross the barrier and drink the real thing not this blood lite without killing his prey.Regan is sent to the park to investigate what looks like a vampire kill, but she has some doubts because the victim's heart, liver and throat were ripped from his body. Joaquin tells her he believes a werewolf is the predator; an enemy who murdered his wife; furthermore they will attack one another until one is eradicated. Regan is caught in their crosshairs (teeth?) and gets bit by Vasile turning her into a werewolf. She can revert back by killing her "mentor", something that Joaquin has tried and failed at for centuries.Whether she is a mortal or a werewolf, Joaquin bares his heart to Regan, who rejects him initially, but soon notices how kind and gentle he is so she cannot help but return his feelings. Both are strong willed people who understand they must first deal with Vante. Amanda Ashley has written a pulse thumping supernatural thriller that keep readers attention with a burning need to know what happens next.Harriet Klausner

The culture shock, the unbending bureaucracy, the complex and often disaffected attitudes of students, the instant celebrity and lack of privacy that goes with it, are all symptoms that JETs experience. I read the book and often found myself nodding in agreement, having experience the same events and feelings myself. If you want to have an intimate look at the world of education in Japan today, Feiler's book is an excellent place to start. If you are thinking about joining the JET program, this book is a must, along with Importing Diversity.

Chaim Potok often writes about the conflicts of pursuing your dreams when everyone else is trying to derail your efforts. Although Chaim Potok revisits this theme in several of his books, he has something new to say each time. Each story he crafts makes you feel you actually know these characters even though his characters may come from a culture totally alien to the reader. Chaim Potok writes about the Jewish people in such a way that we are reminded that we have more things in common with each other than differences. I keep talking about all this mumbo jumbo when I should just say this is among Chaim Potok's best stories. It ranks right up there with &quot;My Name is Asher Lev.&quot

Or plain. Or lacking in grand history (meaningless "historic markers" occur a-plenty). It is driving through Small Town America that is all those things. So why did someone of Bryson's intelligence not pretty it up? Why not throw in enough "redeeming" nuggets here and there? As some reviewers here suggest it would have made him more "quick bucks".The answer, of course, is the answer to that age old question - why does a writer need to be true?You picked up a book subtitled "Travels through Small Town America". What did you expect? Small Town America, especially of Bryson's sampling, primarily reveals itself to the traveler through its strip malls, and its sale of cheap calories. Conversation is whittled down to the stock oft-repeated phrases of service indifferently provided. And Bryson gives it to the reader in all its repetitive and bland glory, redeemed only by the spice of his cynicism. Not strong enough, this spice, one feels as one reads the book. But having finished it one realizes that had the spice been a lot stronger it would leave a bitter aftertaste. I think Bryson pulls his punches appropriately while being completely honest. I think he pays a bigger price for this honesty than the most dissatisfied reader. Isn't happy denial an easier state to be in when driving 6000 miles through Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama...? Why constantly remind oneself that this is not fun? That one's childhood memories cannot be recovered or are disappointing when they can? Why does a writer need to be true?This is not a great book, the subject matter would not allow that. But it is a unique book. It is clear that the writer who undertook this 6000-mile drive is a dedicated traveler. I shudder to think of those 6000 miles. And I thank Bryson for doing it and sharing his journey. I don't have to.

The applications of neural networks are enormous and include fields such as financial engineering, network modeling, computational radiology, medicine, and brain modeling.For readers who know C++, this book gives a thorough overview of neural networks from the standpoint of the source code used to represent them. It is expected that the reader has had some exposure to neural networks, for no detailed discussion is given of their history or properties. The author attempts to stick to a purely object-oriented framework, and refrains from giving what he calls a &quot;coarse-grained&quot; approach to an object-oriented implementation of neural networks. The later according to him is merely a collection of C++ wrappers around existing C code. The base objects are the nodes and links of the neural networks, called the Base-Node and Base-Link classes in the book. The author admits this approach degrades performance, but design and development of complicated neural net architectures is enhanced, he argues.After a brief review of object-oriented programming in chapter 2, the author treats the neural network base classes in chapter 3. He defines a neural net as a 3-tuple consisting of a pattern set, parameters, and topology. The ADALINE, backpropagation, Kohonen self-organizing, and BAM neural-network architectures are treated throughout the book in chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. The XOR problem is discussed as an example of learning with a backpropagation neural network, along with an example from lithology. Also, for those readers who are using compilers that do not support template classes, the author creates a generic backpropagation neural-network class. This class is constructed to make the creation of a back-propagation class more transparent.The only major problem with the book is the lack of examples illusrating the Kohonen and BAM neural networks and the lack of in-depth discussion of neural networks. For readers very familiar with neural networks and C++, this book should work well.

After reading some of the reviews of this book, I would have assumed it wasn't really that good. However, I have read it from cover-to-cover, and very familiar with the air battles of WWII, and have NOT read any of his other books.First of all, I'll deal with the last item. I have not read any of the author's previous works. I don't know what subjects he covered with those books, but for the topic at hand, the behind-the-scenes look at the USAAC/USAAF before and during WWII, he does a brilliant job. More on that in a minute.If you are looking for a book that covers the details of every major air combat in WWII, this is not your book. If you want a book that gives the details of each mission and how it was fought...not your book. If you want a book that ties the details of how the generals fought the war, what they decided to do, how it impacted the overall battles and conflict...this is your book. This book ties together all the details that you never hear when you read the other books...why was Ploesti bombed multiple times at a heavy cost, and what did it really gain us? Why did none of our fighters have the range of our bombers at the start of the war (they could have)? Why did we change from daylight "precision" bombing in Europe to night-time mass attack in Japan (which we disagreed with in Europe)? Why did the Navy control the bombs that the USAAF dropped?This book covers all that, and does it very well. Given that it doesn't talk about the battles so much as the reasons behind them, it is still very engrossing. Understanding why we did what we did was very enlightening to be able to tie with the knowledge of the specific air battles we fought. Knowing what Arnold, Spaatz and the other generals (and our allies) thought put all the pieces in place. If you want a book that does that, this book is for you.I also don't agree with the reviewer who claimed that the author "had it in" for specific people. The author covered each person who majorly influenced US air power in WWII pretty well. I feel he respected most of them, but if they had a flaw, he didn't cut them any slack and gloss it over. You get to see what lead each one of them into a position of leadership over the USAAF when WWII kicked off.Several other reviewers commented that it seemed there was too much general reciting of attacks later in the book (such as when the bombing campaign of Germany began). I didn't find that at all, and if they think this book is bad, they should read some other books where the recitation of each mission becomes very droll after a bit.If there is a flaw to this book (besides a few very minor items), it is perhaps that he uses generalizations a bit more, but this is a book about the overall impact of the USAAF in WWII, not specific units, people or battles.At any rate, enjoyed it greatly. Makes a good volume to add to my collection.

This is a very interesting book about Stalingrad because it looks at the whole 1942 campaign to put Stalingrad into political, strategic, and economic context. And its focus on how the Luftwaffe contributed so much to all 1942 battles, and the Sixth Army's unsuccessful supply, is almost entirely new. A well done &quot;essential&quot; book.

The surprising aspect of the book is that persuading other Justices was not so much recruiting as it was threatening, deceiving, placating, or other forms of work place politics.This is all shocking until one realizes where the tension originates. These years are portrayed as a struggle between the noble and almost mythic Justices left over from the previous era - the Warren Court - and the new Justices, a.k.a. the Nixon appointees. Inevitably in the book, your appreciation will depend on your political leanings. "The Brethren" is, more than any book I've ever read, a product of its times. It reflects the anti-war, anti-establishment, anti-Nixon, pro-activist, and downright revolutionary times of the early 1970s. If you choose to read "The Brethren," you should understand that it takes positions as being either right or wrong. And with political powder kegs (abortion, busing, the Watergate tapes, the death penalty, etc.), that is an intellectually risky proposition.Worth mentioning are also some lighter moments. Anything relating to the Justices and the obscenity/pornography cases of that time will have you telling your friends about this book. Those parts are filled with priceless humor. My final opinion, however, is that I'm glad I read it (really) but I wouldn't strongly recommend it.

It even includes Linear B Mycenaean Greek entries. This gargantuan work is the definitive Greek-English dictionary. I was not able to read Pindar or the Lyric poets easily without the Big Liddle. My major gripe is that it is rather poorly made. The edges of the very thin pages stuck together and each page had to be separated by hand or flicking the pages. The paper is sliver thin, and some of it was creased in the binding - upsetting in a $160 book. On reviewing the front, I noted that it was printed and bound in China and can't help feeling that if it were printed in Europe or the US it might have been better quality. Eventually, the pages separated and I am now able to use it without problems (although the few creased pages still irritate me).Regard this review as five stars for content but three for the quality of binding/manufacture.

Devlin does an excellent job in explaining the mathematics at a level of basic understanding, although to his credit he does not hesitate to include formulas and equations when they are necessary.Some of the topics covered are:*) Formal grammars*) Number theory*) Conic sections*) Logical reasoning*) The fundamental geometries*) Basic topology*) Fundamental probabilityIn each section, Devlin's goal is to explain the material well enough so that the reader can understand and appreciate the value that it brings to the mathematical world. He is very successful in this endeavor, developing the topic in sufficient yet with no unnecessary detail so that the bright and dedicated reader will be able to appreciate the overall beauty and utility of mathematics.

What today might be considered cruel and highly unusual was then a way for Benedetta's somewhat well-to-do parents to provide their daughter with protection. After several years at the nunnery which Brown describes as fairly unremarkable, Benedetta began to have a series of increasingly disturbing visions, including being sexually harassed by demons. Sister Benedetta was eventually assigned a companion named Bartolomea Crivelli (also a sister in the convent) whose presence, as the subtitle hints at, would later become problematic for her. Bartolomea's job was to assist Benedetta through her "periods of ecstasy," and was present when she supposedly received the stigmata and exchanged mystical hearts with Christ.Naturally, this caught the attention of a Counter-Reformation Catholic Church whose main goal was maintaining a sense of propriety. Two separate people (men, naturally) were set out to Pescia to investigate what was happening. Stefano Cecchi was the first to investigate Benedetta over a number of visits throughout late 1619. Cecchi's main purpose was to ensure that she was remaining within theologically accepted boundaries, which she was extremely conscious of doing, knowing that moving outside of them would have put her reputation, and more importantly her life, in danger. Cecchi, satisfied that Benedetta was not a heretic, left quietly to resume his position as the provost of Pescia. At least for a while, things appeared to return to normal inside the convent.At some time between August 1622 and March 1623, the papal nuncio sent several representatives, led by Alfonso Giglioli, to examine Benedetta's claims again. In 1620, she had become an abbess at the incredibly young age of thirty, but had been deeply troubled by the recent death of her father. The nuncio's representatives proceeded much in the same way as in the earlier set of visits. Their final ruling on Benedetta's case isn't even given until the beginning of the epilogue:"The story of Benedetta Carlini is shrouded in mystery for the next forty years. No records exist of the nuncio's pronouncements, and it is only the chance survival of one fragment of one nun's diary that allows us to know the outcome. On August 7, 1661, that nun, whose name has not come down to us, wrote in her diary: `Benedetta Carlini died at age 71 of fever and colic pains after eighteen days of illness. She died in penitence, having spent thirty-five years in prison'" (p. 132).At this point, you might be wondering, "And the lesbianism? What about the lesbianism?" Its relevance and Brown's discussion of it are extraordinarily fleeting. Bartolomea gave testimony that Benedetta sexually molested her and engaged in frottage with her while possessed by the spirit of a male demon known as Splenditello. While Benedetta and Bartolomea's sexual behavior merits perhaps a few sentences in the book, in the Introduction and peppered throughout the text, Brown discusses how Benedetta used Splenditello's "maleness" as a foil to explain away her rape of Bartolomea (and according to Bartolomea's testimony, that's exactly what it was). The book remains ambiguous as to whether Benedetta deliberately used her male demon as an excuse, or whether she actually thought he possessed her, but the nuncio's representatives seem unconvinced as they accuse her of "pretending" to be a mystic, and being a "woman of ill repute."One wonders what Brown's motivation was in giving the book such a gratuitous title. The content of the book, a scholarly interpretation of a set of documents couched deep in the State Archive of Florence entitled "Papers relating to a trial against Sister Benedetta Carlini of Vellano, abbess of the Theatine nuns of Pescia, who pretended to be a mystic, but who was discovered to be a woman of ill repute," isn't really commensurate with the sensationalism of the title. The book provides an intelligent analysis of a lot of topics, from early seventeenth-century life to cultural assumptions of sex and gender. I almost wished the publishers would have chosen one of those horribly academic titles to give a better impression of what it was all about. I vote for "Transgressing Normative Gender Identities Through Self-Conscious Afflatus in Renaissance Italy." But then someone's going to pick it up thinking that "afflatus" means something dirty. Sometimes you just can't win.

I guess that's what makes the story so compelling is that compared to his life, my life seems very ordinary. I have always found fascination in mentally inbalanced individuals and what drives them. Having said that, one can learn from his childhood and young adult experiences which is why I recommend this to everyone interested in the psychology of criminals. The book in its simplicity can make for good reading that even grade school students can comprehend. Had this book been available in high school I would have loved to have done a book report on it myself. The book is coherent, intelligent and gramatically well written. At times I question the authenticity in a lot of statements and the situations that he had gotten himself into, but one thing to add to that is the fact that he had nothing anymore to gain or loose by lying; the fact can't be overlooked that Manson is a natural born lier and an expert at deceipt and it is and always will be in his blood.

It's packed into every page, every line. Tillich is concerned with how the question of finding the courage to face up to existential doubts about death, meaninglessness, and guilt are tied to the ontological questions of being versus nonbeing. How can we affirm our existence when it seems so temporary, meaningless and full of moral failure? Tillich explores with incredible freshness and insight age old strategies, from Spinoza to the Stoics (his discussion of the Stoics alone is worth the price of the book). He gives a brilliant account of how people find the courage to overcome existential anxiety through particpation in groups and through individual strategies like existentialism. Finally, he explores the theological implications in a way that may challenge anyone who has stereotyped Tillich as a mouthpiece for Christianity. The book is excellently written, never dumbed down but always graspable. He also litters the book with brilliant asides on subjects like the history of existential angst and its relations to social relations and a great exploration of existential art. Don't pass this one up.

But now it's the 21st Century and Type 2 diabetes hasn't just risen, but exploded into a full-fledged epidemic as one of the biggest health threats of our day. What's really scary is the fact that the problem is expected to get that much worse over the next few decades. Yikes!In 1997, Dr. Richard K. Bernstein first introduced what would become the pinnacle diabetes bible to the world when he published the first edition of The Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars. Controversial, against the grain, but extremely effective, the low-carbohydrate dietary approach to treating diabetes has never been more clearly explained.Now, Dr. Bernstein has revised and expanded his classic bestselling book to make it even better than it was when it released a decade ago. As a man who has lived with Type 1 diabetes since childhoood, he knows from whence he speaks and now wants to help others find the "solution" that he dicovered a long time ago.Controlling diabetes as much as possible without little to no use of insulin or medications is the goal of The Diabetes Solution. While the American Diabetes Association (ADA) feels good about recommending a high-carb, low-fat diet (which requires HIGHER doses of insulin and prescription diabetes drugs), Dr. Bernstein believes that is the wrong way to go about managing blood sugars.Written in a very informative and entertaining style, this book answers all those little nagging questions diabetics may have about this method of treatment, including the uniquely damaging role of carbohydrate in the diet, what the best pharmaceuticals and how they can help, a comprehensive look at the various types of insulin and which should be used, and what to do to manage your disease naturally.Is low-carb dieting controversial? Sure. But so are a whole lot of other things that we used to think were strange, but now they're normal years later after much research has proven them to be true. The same goes for the low-carb lifestyle as a treatment option for diseases like diabetes and aiding in weight loss. The science is catching up to a reality that Dr. Bernstein unveiled years ago.I personally lost nearly 200 pounds on this way of eating. Although I don't have diabetes, it runs in my family and I was borderline when I weighed over 400 pounds. But then I started a low-carb diet in 2004 and changed my life forever. Dr. Robert C. Atkins, like Dr. Bernstein, was also before his time espousing the benefits of livin' la vida low-carb.Living with diabetes need not be a hopeless situation where you feel all alone. Dr. Bernstein has The Diabetes Solution and wants you to experience the freedom that comes from knowing you can beat your diabetes. Never give up the hope for a better life, even with diabetes.Dr. Bernstein, we salute you for your contribution to diabetes management and low-carb living. You should be honored and hailed for standing up for what you know is right and refusing to just settle for the failed methods for treating your diabetes. I think your life speaks for itself. CONGRATULATIONS!

I read his columns religiously and have read many of his other books--the entire second half of my copy of "Vision of the Anointed" is copiously dog-eared, highlighted and asterisk'd. I am not the partisan opposition.That said, this book was stupefyingly dull. In "Vision," I read some passages over and over, amazed at their profundity. Likewise, on 3 or 4 occasions I did the same thing in this book. However, to get to those 3-4 profound paragraphs you have to slog through 250+ pages of the dryest material you'll ever run across. This thing reads like a philosophy textbook (or the "ChomskyBot:" search for it on Google). It requires an incredible deal of concentration to make sense. It seemed that no one sentence, or collection of two or three sentences, had independent meaning. I had to read an entire paragraph or page just to get a glimpse of the superficial meaning of a concept Sowell was trying to explain. As a whole the thesis and book itself are meaningful, but there are so many paragraphs that could have been left out on account of their mind-numbing redundancy (another reviewer mentioned this) or because the message was so nebulous.As an example, here is a fairly characteristic sentence from the book:Social decisions evolve systematically from the interactions of individual discretion, exercised for individual benefit, in the constrained vision--servicing the common good only as an individually unintended consequence of the characteristics of systemic processes such as a competitive market economy (p. 103).Now this passage has meaning, but if you have the attention span or ability to concentrate of a mere mortal (like myself), this will be VERY difficult reading. It's hard to believe the average person could grasp the meaning of this book after even three reads.In summary, despite a couple of profound passages and overall meaningful message, this book is bogged down by its own redundancy, opacity and length.

However, Mr. Hutton fails to understand that a lack of evidence does not equate to an evidence of lack.It would be convenient if things were really as black and white as Mr. Hutton views them, or if the topic of modern witchcraft were simply a matter of starting with the influence of Gerald Gardner and his cohorts. Unfortunately this is not the case, and there are more things on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in this book.Regretfully, Mr. Hutton glosses over the influence of Charles Leland, the true father of modern Wicca, and fails to see that virtually every basic aspect of Gardnerian Wicca can be identified in Leland's 19th century writings on Italian witchcraft. Leland's material depicts witches gathering nude at the time of the full moon, worshipping a male and female deity, working magic, and celebrating the sabbat with cakes and wine, etc. And yet Mr. Hutton states there is no evidence of anything resembling such aspects prior to Gerald Gardner's writings.I think the author was correct to state in the introduction that this book should have been subtitled a book on British witchcraft.

Having lived in the US for several months now, it is a constant source of astonishment to me how biased (pro-Israeli government) the US media is in covering the Israel-Palestine conflict.I'm not just talking about the European media: Haaretz (a respectable left-wing newspaper in Israel) has the following to say about operation 'Cast Lead': "Six months ago Israel asked and received a cease-fire from Hamas. It unilaterally violated it when it blew up a tunnel, while still asking Egypt to get the Islamic group to hold its fire." (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/attack-on-gaza-as-usual-u_b_153757.html). You would never read anything like this in the mainstream US media.So I find Mamdani's analysis to be pretty even handed and insightful. He has done the research to back up his thoroughgoing historical analysis of the conflict. I urge people to read this account to see how much of the rest of the world views the Israel-Palestine conflict and the rest of the US' 'interventions' in other nations over the past fifty years. Unlike many US citizens, the rest of the world has neither forgiven nor forgotten the US' actions, and as a Brit I know only too well that the actions of an imperial nation have consequences that last decades and affect untold millions.Mamdani's thesis is simply this: only by understanding the historic context of current events and acting accordingly can we create a world of peace and mutual respect.

After living in Japan for a few years (not on the JET Programme) I recognized a lot of truth to what Feiler had to say. This book also provided me with an inside look at and the pros and cons of the Japanese school system. Through my own experience, I honestly am amazed at the amount of pressure placed on students to do well in school in Japan. For the most part, the students' effort pays off when they are accepted into a great high school or college, regardless of the two-hour-one-way commute some of them endure. At the same time, however, I wish the school system in Japan encouraged students to be more creative and that the environment allowed them to learn more about the world around them. Despite that, though, the Japanese people make great students and are some of the nicest people you'll meet in your life. This book, through the author's experiences in Tochigi Prefecture, show this and more, all in an entertaining, well-written way. And if for that reason alone, this book is worth reading once for anyone interested in Japan.

It's like watching public health films from the era when boys all had crew cuts and said, "Golly!" It's from a time when men were men and women were domestic, and carried bridal shower gifts home in a "laundry basket, decorated for the purpose."My favorite part about it has to be the myriad ways in which it makes all modern wedding magazines liars. For instance, this season it's hot to have white bridesmaids' dresses. Editors would have you believe that this used to be a no-no, and that you (and Kate Middleton) are breaking some kind of taboo. Actual quote from this book: "An old-fashioned and charming affectation is to have an all-white wedding." Also included are discussions of how it's totally okay to have no engagement ring or a colored stone. And they tout keeping bridesmaids' dresses "within a reasonable budget." Gasp!This book is charming, well-written, and just fun for an evening of sitting and reading. I don't know how seriously anyone could take it, but it is a wonderful window into the past.

First of all, he gets his backing from the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian organization that opposes government regulation, especially regulation of industry. Thus it comes as no surprise that his favorite target is 'junk science' which, if left unchecked might, lead to goverment regulation of industry.A lot of what he attacks in fact (in this book, in other books, on his website,) is not 'junk science' at all, but rather those who employ what is called the 'precautionary principle,' in other words the notion that us humans should play it safe when we don't know what it is we are dealing with.It is this doctrine that is the reason that drugs need to be tested in this country before the FDA will allow them to be sold. In other words, government regulation. People like Milloy hate the precautionary principle and it's practitioners becuase they hate regulation.Nevertheless, you might walk away from this book with a little perspective - that science and people are imperfect, and often in error. Perhaps, that science itself is often far from objective. Then again, Milloy is hardly objective himself (although he puports to be.) I would recommend reading something like Toxic Sludge is Good for You! as well for a little more perspective on this important subject, as well as on Milloy himself.

On a whim I got this book, and within 15 mins had a pretty good-sized crochet sample that was neat and contained several different stitches.For such a small book there are very detailed instructions for beginner crocheters for many stitch variations and projects. The directions are so crystal clear that even a younger teenager would have no problems learning, and the projects are contemporary and varied. Teens and young adults would especially like some of the projects, such as a delicate lacy camisole or the beach cover-up. I crocheted a square variation on the cat bed which my cat adores. The example pictures use yarns with shimmer and contrasting colors so the stitches really stand out, a solution to an annoying problem I have had with many knitting and crochet books. As an added bonus, the book has a trifold so you can stand it up and look at it as you crochet.

Type foundries create and sell fonts as a matter of business. Trades like printing and advertising have historically publicized type by using it, and driven the creation of new fonts. Typography is also distinctive in that, for such small field, it has so many large personalities.Stanley Morison is one of those personalities, and one of the people who made 20th century typography what it was. He had a unique insight into the type trade of the first half of that century, as well as a wealth of history about several other centuries of type design and designers.The most strinking feature of this book is the way each chapter about some important typeface is set in that face. Seeing and reading a whole page of body text, set and spaced in the usual way, is fundamentally different from seeing menu of &quot;quick brown foxes&quot; or pages of nonsense words. Reading the type is different from looking at letterforms, so this gives real information that specimen books can never provide. (As a personal matter, I realized just how much I dislike the italics with slope angles different in the capitals than in the lower case.)Don't pick this up as a text on typography; beginners won't get much they can use. If you already appreciate that subtle art, if you want to learn more about its history and practice, this is a very enjoyable way to learn.

It is full of humor, insight and clear thinking. Mr. Feiler clearly but a lot of thought into his visit and is just as clear in explaining to us what he feels is the important and major issues that Japan has to deal with - not just then but now and in the future. A must for any library on Asia or Japan.

While it is sometimes exhausting to read through the author's detailed coverage of the works of each featured artist, it should be considered mandatory reading for artists and art historians -- so that all can see the pillars of art on which civilization is built. The author covers both the works and the private lives of the artists, although I would have personally prefered more emphasis on the personal lives. It would also be very nice to have pictures of the specific works in each bio, so I guess that might be a future book purchase here at Amazon(!) -- a visual reference to Renaissance Art. In spite of those two drawbacks, I highly recommend the purchase of this book.

The book parodies not only the prose of eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (as with the page-long sentence on the evils of verbosity) but also the political and philosophical movements of the time. Throw-away references to experimental physics, ecclesiastical history, etc. will probably lose everyone at some point. I'm sure I missed some (or a lot) of the jokes. As well, the authors are overly faithful to the voice of their narrators. If you don't have the background to catch the (often subtle) barbs, many passages will read as unleavened pedantry.In spite of that, I recommend this book for those with patience. Not as comedy, exactly - though it has hilarious moments, they're not that frequent. Instead, I'd place it more in the hazy area of the Princess Bride - a story superficially impossible to take seriously, but ultimately very serious indeed. Beneath the antics, there's a real message about human nature. The characters may be literally larger than life, but they are complex and compelling.Having a large vocabulary or a willingness to expand it rapidly will help. So will knowing something about nationalism and imperialism.

Rachel, with the help of a very competent therapist, is able to change the distorted way she thinks about and reacts to things, and is transformed from a self destructive person who hurts herself and those closest to her as she lashes out during her emotional storms, to someone who has ups and downs that are manageable, someone who is no longer out of control. It is very encouraging to see that someone as ill as the protagonist of this story is, who is ill enough to be hospitalized three times within a year or so, and who needs heavy duty psychiatric medications to control her emotional outbursts, can be healed. That to me is the strength of this story. It shows the ability of the human brain to change. The book shows how one person was able to change her brain (and thus, her life) with motivation, a lot of support from an extremely tolerant and patient husband, a skilled psychiatrist, and time.The sessions with the therapist are very detailed and give a great insider view of what it is like to struggle with the illness of borderline personality disorder. And if one is not familiar with freudian therapeutic techniques, this story provides some useful, basic information, such as the therapist's role as a *blank screen*, which is an idea I was not familiar with and found interesting.I would have to say that I would have liked to have learned more about Rachel's life outside of the the therapist's office. Toward the end of the book, the author does talk more about her relationships with her family and friends, and her spiritual journey, and I enjoyed that part of the book a bit more than the rest of it. The first two thirds of the book is pretty focused on the relationship between her and her therapist. I would have liked to have more information about her early childhood. It was left somewhat vague as to what exactly happened there, perhaps to protect family members. I also would have liked to have heard more from the husband's point of view. And I would have liked more detail about how her relationship with her children was transformed.All, in all, although it is not a literary masterpiece, it was a book I learned a lot from, and as I said before, it is a story of a journey which can give hope to others. It makes me wish that everyone who was suffering from issues like these could find the support they need to get better.

I followed all of the instructions perfectly for the apple pie. After several hours of preparation, using a baking stone covered with foil, a temperature of 425 degrees (preheated for 20 minutes), etc., the pie was just okay. The bottom crust browned but was soggy, the filling tasted good but was undercooked. I reduced the liquid from the macerated apples to just above the 1/3 cup recommended. However, it never bubbled out of the top of the crust and didn't thicken in the pie (I used the cornstarch on the apples as instructed). If I had cooked it any longer (10 min. longer than recommended didn't help), the pie crust on top would have been shoe leather. The top crust was delicious and flaky and looked beautiful. I did learn to fill the pie pan with the crust and refrigerate it before cooking to prevent shrinkage and produce flakiness. I plan on trying another recipe in this book in the future but I know now to devote my entire day to each recipe. I can't imagine baking tons of holiday pies with so many steps to take for each one. I have been looking for the ultimate pie crust secrets and this book is good for providing information on flours, chilling factors, etc.. Cooking is my hobby so as a textbook, it will be extremely helpful.

This book draws a basic emotional response from the people I know who have read it so far - they either love it or hate it. And an emotional response is precicely what sets this book apart from two others, Into Thin Air and The Climb, written about the same expedition. In Climbing High, Ms. Gammelgaard does not get into the hows or whys, the could haves or should haves, or the blaming and explaining and of the other two. Climbing High isn't a book about the entire Everest expedition and the author doesn't try to tell everyone else's story or relay other people's intentions or motives. It is a tunnel vision book about what it took for one person to reach the summit; about what one person saw and thought and felt and experienced before, during, and after climbing Mt. Everest. I found the author's honesty about herself and her abilities courageous and refreshing. Her description of the physical effort and sheer will required to achieve her personal goal, &quot;to the summit and safe return&quot; didn't leave much to the imagination. Written almost as a journal, this book describes climbing the world's highest mountain while giving the reader a clear and uncompromising view into the soul of a strong and determined single woman. A woman whose achievements speak for themselves.

This text is a great starting point for anyone studying for the NCE, but I would recommend going into more depth then just studying from Rosenthal's book.

I would recommend finding texts in career counseling, research methods, and stats and becoming fimilar with all the basic concepts. Combining Rothenthal's book with texts cited above seems to be the recipe for success

Feldstein, with Don Cohen (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003) is a must read.Better Together tells the stories of twelve different groups: from a community organization to a church, as well as a dance group and a web site, from a union to a branch library, a Fortune 500 corporation and a neighborhood group, to name a few. The stories hold in common the building up of community, of social capital. It is the best book of general interest that I have read in more than a year.Putnam addresses a critical aspect of how we are brought together as citizens and neighbors. I cannot stress enough how highly I recommend this book.

Or for that matter psychological, philisophical or religious. Nash's poetry, written from the early 20's to the late 50's is remark on the social niceties. A critique of the love-hate relationship of men and women. A funny peek into the lives of animals. And silly stories for the sake of being silly. The uniqueness in Nash's work is not the poetry itself, but his play with words. Its clear he does not take language seriously at all which allows him to mix and maneuver words to create new ones that will create a genuine laugh. Such as: &quot;Well I have learned that life is something about which you can't conclude anything except that it is full of vicissitudes. And when you expect logic you only come across eccentricitudes.&quot; The other aspect of Nash's writing is his outlaw verse where, although things rhyme, the rythm is thown askew.&quot;I know that a year has rolled around once moreWhen I find myself thumbing a crisp new cigarette lighter just like the coven of other cigarette lighters strewn on a shelf in the garage along with the broken tire chains and the license plates for 1934.&quot;Nash's work was surely ahead of its time and I am dleighted to have come across such remarkable work. I highly reccomend this, not just to poetry lovers, but also to those that appreciate language and humor.

Marianne Moore created her own net - her poetry is built upon strict syllabic counts she imposed upon herself. The result is finely crafted poetry that is never self-indulgent.I have found her syllabic count to be a good way to introduce structure into student's poetry. I have found it to be a good writing exercise. And in using the structure in these ways, I have become ever more impressed with the quality of work she achieved. But more than the technical quality, I enjoy the humor and just plain fun of her animal poems.

Who's Vicente Huidobro you ask? The least known of the top echelon of Latin American avant-garde (or "vanguardista" in Spanish) poets of the 20th century.Impressive enough in Spanish, with its incredible wordplay and thought-provoking imagery, what's more impressive is Eliot Weinberger's translation. He's the only one who's ever published a translation of the entire thing (everyone else just translates excerpts); this is due to the incredible difficulty of translating some of the complicated linguistic games Huidobro plays with words, which Weinberger actually does a very good job of.Four star worthy if you can only read the translation; easily five star worthy if you can read both the original and the translation.

In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them.

Devlin: "The particular topics I have chosen are all central themes within mathematics... But the fact is, I could have chosen any collection of seven or eight general areas and told the same story; That mathematics is the science of patterns, and those patterns can be found anywhere you care to look for them, in the physical universe, in the living world, or even in our own minds. And that mathematics serves us by making the invisible visible."At this writing it has been more than a few years since my last class in mathematics. But I liked math as a student and still do, even at the point that notation and degree of abstraction begins to hurt my head, so to speak, I still like it. There is a solidity and a beauty in mathematics that eclipses the empirical sciences. It is not only the practical applicability, logical purity, and beauty of mathematics that interest me, it is also its very immateriality. As Devlin states, "music exists not on the printed page, but in our minds. The same is true for mathematics; the symbols on a page are just a representation of the mathematics."This is a wonderful book. Before 1900, mathematics could be wholly categorized within about a dozen subjects. While advances are still being made in some of these older disciplines -- Devlin discusses how developments in number theory are being applied to encryption for such purposes as banking security -- there are now at least 60-70 somewhat distinct disciplines of mathematics. The author reveals the logical foundations, history, and current applications of number theory, mathematical logic, the calculus, relativistic geometry, topology, and probability. Applications of mathematics to such seemingly far-flung fields as linguistics, electrodynamics, and astrophysics are briefly but aptly considered. He introduces us to the patterns and progressions of perceptive minds, from the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics, to Pascal and Penrose, with glances at Galileo, Gauss and Godel. [Okay, enough alliteration ... just having a little fun with patterns; and patterns, as Devlin instructs, is precisely what mathematics is all about.]

It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel.

I find that if I follow her recipe EXACTLY, the results are spectacular. However, following her recipe exactly takes a lot of time, if you take any shortcut, or delete a setp, then the results are less than average. I recommend this book for people who want excellent results and are willing to invest a lot of time, effort, and money in their baking. Rose's instructions are very precise, so I think all levels of cooks could use this book successfully. I would not recommend this cookbook for anyone who wants to spend less than an afternoon baking a pie or pastry.

This is a smoothly written tome, however, after Perret's earlier--and better--efforts it is a genuine disappointment. The general complaints about this work have been ably delt with elsewhere so here is a partial listing of Perret's errors of fact (See the works of Gordon Swanborough, William Green, and Francis K. Mason for supporting documentation).>pg.27-28: The first Boeing Model 299's were designated as operational test aircraft, thus the alpha numeric 'Y1B-17' not YB-17. The aircraft's nickname "Flying Fortress" was coined not by Boeing but by a local Seattle newspaper.>pg.48: The RAF was not "...clamoring...for the B-17...having done almost nothing about four engined bombers.." By the time the RAF received its 20 B-17C's Bomber Command was already operating several squadrons each of Short Sterlings and Handley-Page Halifaxes with the first Lancasters less than a year away. All were long range four-engined heavy bombers of UK design and manufacture.>pg.40: "The Spitfire was inferior to the Me-109." Perret loves this wartime misidentification of Messerschmitt's -109 and -110 and keeps repeating it. The proper designation is and was Bf-109 and Bf-110. As for the 'inferiority' of the Spitfire about which Perret is so sure it is contradicted directly by General Adolf Galland the Lutwaffe's fighter commander who favored the RAF's mount.>pg.67: The first US-manned squadron, "Eagle Squadron", in the RAF was not designated the 71st Fighter Squadron. It was simply, 71 Squadron.>pg.69: Iceland was not occupied by the US 5th Division. It was occupied by USMC units that included the 5th Marine Regiment.>pg.92-93: The B-25D was not a development of the B-25C. The letter designation here denotes their location of manufacture; California=C, Texas=D.>pg.119: Mustang Mk.I's were not operated by the RAF's Desert Air Force in the summer of 1942. A small number were operated in early 1943 by 14 Squadron of the DAF. Mustang's were never armed with eight 0.303-in machine guns. The Mark I, an RAF/RCAF-only version, carried four o.303's and four 0.5-in machine guns. All other versions dispensed completely with the 0.303 guns.>pg.186: "No Allied fighter of 1942 could match [FW-190]." The Spitfire F. Mk. IXc was more than a match for the -190 and entered service with the RAF in July 1942. It was developed precisely to combat the FW-190 and it more than succeeded.>pg.196: No 75-mm cannon-armed B-25G's or -H's saw operatinal service in the MTO. They operated with limited success in the CBI and the Pacific.>pg.250: "...B-24 had no belly turret." The version referred to here, the D, carried the same Sperry ball turret as the did some B-17E's and all B-17F's thru G's.>pg.260: "...faired 108 gallon belly tank as the Hurricane." The arrangement of the RAF Hurricane's undercarriage and radiator precluded the use of ventral tanks. The tanks Perret refers to were not faired but rather torpedo-shaped. They were mounted ventrally on Spitfires and under the wings of Hurricanes. Later it was to be used by RAF/RCAF Tempests F. MkV and VI, the Thunderbolt F Mk. I and II as well as the Mustang F Mk. III and IV (P-51B,C,D and K) of the USAAF, the RAAF and the afored mentioned services.>pg.270: The AAF did not force North America to redesign the P-51 Mustang around wing tanks. The very first operation RAF/RCAF Mutang Mk. I's had wing tanks and with them exceptionally long range.I think I have proven my point.Beware of Perret's us of both Barrett Tillman and Bill Sweetman in his footnotes. Both are prolific aviation authors but both prefer a good tale over hard technical facts.

This book is somewhat unusual among mathematical texts in that it is heavy on prose and (compared to other texts) light on equations. However, don't get the idea that it is any less rigorous! It simply focuses on precisely what most math books neglect: exhaustive explanation of the concepts...and to very good effect. Jaynes (and his editor) are possibly the most articulate writers of mathematics I've ever read. If you can read equations like English, you may not appreciate this. The rest of us will.Summarizing the content: The book very exhaustively demonstrates how Bayesian statistical approaches subsume rather than compete with "orthodox" (sampling theory-derived) statistics. Importantly, it begins by deriving the sum and product rules (which in other texts are typically presented as axioms) from "common sense" considerations. In other words, what is usually treated as "given" in other statistics texts is shown to, in fact, depend on even more fundamental (and, thus, indisputable) considerations of what constitutes rational plausible reasoning. This places the whole endeavor of statistics on firmer ground than any other text I've seen. The book is worth buying for the first few chapters alone, but it just gets better from there.Jaynes goes on to link Bayes rule to information-theoretic considerations and build up probability as an extended form of logic (as the title implies). In some cases this yields a new and deeper understanding of "orthodox statistical practice." In others it exposes (and explains) the absurdities of strictly frequentist approaches. Again, I have rarely learned so much from one book.One caveat: It does not at all require a statistics background, but, obviously, some of Jaynes (mildly polemical) discourse will, of course, be lost on you without it.

The organization and notation of symbols of the book was very odd, and therefore made it hard to read. Rather than talking about the theory first, the authors first state the equations, and then talk about "remarks" on the equations and underlying theory. The book contains very easy and introductory examples and problems, not practical examples that would help in the computer implementation of finite elements. For example, the book does not contain any examples on how to compute the stresses and strains from interconnected finite elements (which would help greatly when you want to write your own finite element program). Overall, a very confusing and brief presentation of the topics. I would not recommend this book.

I should have done more research before I bought this, but the book is exactly what it says it is; a book about routers.The 2 main points against it are- as someone else said, very little technique. As I mentioned, it's about routERS and not routING, which is my fault for not researching thoroughly- it has a lot of information about specific models, which is likely to be outdated and useless quite quickly.

Not only does it cover the drumset it also has instructions on how to play a bunch of other drums including congas and bongos and quite few that I'd never heard of before. It also has rhythms and techniques for playing cowbells and shakers and stuff.I want to play in a rock band and I like that this book gives me so much great information on how to play more than just basic beats. I learned about song structure and how to use fills and licks and there's even a section on playing solos! The CD that comes with this book makes it really easy to learn the drum beats.This is the best drumming book that I have.

My reaction to that position is, `so what." If I am a manager considering the adoption of the Rational Unified Process, then my best hope for making the correct adoption decision is to learn what it is designed to do in as short a time as possible. Any material that I can read at a managerial level that explains the capability and what I can get out of it is something of great value, and this book satisfies that requirement.The main purpose of the book is to explain the unified process at the level of the tops of the trees. This broad overview is an explanation of how a process is constructed by splitting it up into nine overlapping, but still somewhat distinct workflows. They are the project management workflow, the business modeling workflow, the requirements workflow, the analysis and design workflow, the implementation workflow, the test workflow, the configuration and change workflow, the environment workflow and the deployment workflow. The separation of the process into the different sections allows each of them to be described from their somewhat unique perspectives, which makes it easier to see how the synergy of them all makes for a complete, effective process.It took some time for it to appear, but it is now essential to examine an item of software from the architectural perspective. Such an encompassing examination of software could not exist until the projects grew to such size and complexity that no other paradigm could adequately describe it. Like the plans for a large, complicated building, it is the overlap of several different models that merge together to build something that is more than the collection of pieces. An entire chapter is devoted to the importance of the architecture in the development and unending refinement of a software project. These are wise words to heed, as anyone who tries to build the complex without a sound plan is almost certainly doomed to failure.The most significant test that any book describing a product can face is whether it is still worth reading if you have no interest in the product. This book easily passes that test and is one of the best manuals for managers of large software projects that is available today.

I agree with the reviewer below who says this shouldn't be your first book. It would indeed be confusing if you had no background in the Craft, since it's not written in a narrative, read-from-beginning-to-end style. It's more like an encyclopedia or cookbook, and jumps from topic to topic with little fanfare or segue. This works pretty well, since if you're a beginner you can find fairly basic stuff easily, and if you've been around a while you can skip ahead to the new stuff.This book contains such things as extensive correspondence tables, spells and chants (well-written, poetry-wise), and advice on various sorts of situations. I was personally pleased to see a section on the Moon Mansions, since they're a particular fascination of mine, and there's not much information about them readily available. I think that's what most people will get from this book--a few treasures that happen to be what they were looking for. Like I mentioned in the title of my review, there's something for everyone.I will concur with other reviewers--this book is mostly written for the teen witch. You don't have to be a teen to read it, but RavenWolf touches on a lot of subjects that are of concern to teens, and helps them find a sense of personal empowerment. She's been criticized for talking down to teens, but I didn't really sense that in this particular book. She's also been criticized for encouraging teens to question authority, but as she says, there are adults out there who don't have teens' best interests at heart! Abusive parents and teachers, sad to say, are out there, and to exhort teens to blindly accept whatever they say is more condescending than RavenWolf's books. And even a teen whose parents and teachers are caring is going through a time when it's natural to question authority. It's part of the process of growing up and forming one's own opinions. Yes, adults can legally control teens' actions, but I don't believe that a teen has to eradicate even rebellious *thoughts* from her/his mind. (This is in response to criticism of RavenWolf's earlier books--she was blasted for saying a teen could be Pagan even if his or her parents disapproved.)I do have two gripes:(1) She criticizes the village &quot;cunning folk&quot; of the past for using the practices of witchcraft without the religion, and even implies that they brought on the witch persecutions. This is not true. These &quot;cunning folk&quot; lived in a time when there was little surviving pagan lore or belief, and of course they would have used only fragments of the old religion, if they used any pagan lore at all. And the witch persecutions were not about paganism, they were about politics and money. The people who were killed were not killed for being pagan, they were killed for being unpopular.(2) A less serious issue, but still irked me--Acne is *not* caused by being dirty! RavenWolf implies that teens who have acne probably have it because they are too lazy to wash their faces. In fact, acne is usually caused by hormonal imbalances, especially an excess of testosterone. Who do you think steroid users break out? And why do girls break out during PMS? Testosterone levels are out of whack. If a teenager who washes her face twice a day but still has zits reads _Solitary Witch_, she may come to believe she's not clean enough--and over-washing the face can actually irritate it and lead to more blemishes.

Sylvester's life is unwrapped before the reader's eyes. It reads at once like a loving biography of a friend lost and social history of a community still grappling with who and what we are. The author gracefully enmeshes Sylvester's glamour with the electricity of a generation on acid and the sadness of an era lost to AIDS and Reagan. I found myself reveling in all the creative fierceness that consumed Sylvester. The Fabulous Sylvester brilliantly examines the productive power of fame and, in doing so, offers us an inspiring glimpse of how truly revolutionary queering gender can be.

Smith	17	17	2006-11-07 16:24:15+08	A decidedly mixed review	This is an important, thoughtful, well-written book that I didn't really like very much. On the one hand, it analyzes the current political/economic situation in the US and argues very convincingly that it parallels the situations that other world-dominating powers (i.e., the Roman Empire, the British Empire, Hapsburg Spain, and the Dutch Republic) faced at the ends of their periods of influence. The comparisons focus on the ways that all of those empires-- and the modern US-- found their societies polarizing, the ways that religious fervor began to influence the governments, the decay of science in the face of faith, rapidly growing national debts, and, most of all, an overweening sense of exceptionalism, which led those empires to become aggressively ignorant about what had happened before them, since they believed that they were not only unique in history, but favored by God.Doing all of this in a single book sounds like too much, and it is. That's why I didn't really care for the book. It's also why I found reading it something of a chore; the reader has to provide a lot of the work needed to connect the dots.However, there's another reason this is an important book. In 1970, the author wrote The Emerging Republican Majority, which correctly predicted and described the current ascendancy of conservative Republicanism in the US. In many ways, he is literally one of the midwives of the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush I, and Bush II administrations. Phillips now finds himself in what must be a very uncomfortable position: The strategy he created has spun wildly out of control, producing what is in his view literally a theocratic political party, the first such in US history. Further, he believes that the consequences of this will be potentially fatal to the republic.By trying to do too much in a single volume, Phillips risks oversimplifying the issues, and at times, he takes rhetorical shortcuts in his arguments. However, his essential theme that the theocratic politicians currently in power have set us on a course that may doom the nation in the same way as earlier empires were doomed is well-supported.So, I see this book as important, but reading it frustrated me in a number of ways.

There is some useful info/discussion in it, if your an absolute beginner to music theory but it is way too lean for someone who is anywhere beyond a couple of introductory lessons and way too confusing/meandering for someone who is a beginner. Your time would be better spent reading something else...Like the other reviewer, I was extremely annoyed by the fact that while Rooksby has a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of Guitar Riff History (he cites an insanely large and diverse number of artists and songs when discussing various points) and cites a huge number of examples, NONE of those examples are presented in musical format. They are discussed verbally at a high level with little technical detail and, as such, it is rarely clear which portion of the song Rooksby is referring to or why it is related to the chapter's core concept since he quotes no actual music. The closest he gets when discussing examples is he will sometimes mention a chord change in the riff he's trying to cite. I mean this is a joke. The artists and songs cited are so diverse as to be obscure, also. So, you'll certainly be unfamiliar with many of the pieces discussed.Oh yes, and I would estimate well over half of the book consists of these confusing, vague non-examples. The actual theory is very thin. Rooksby seems to have confused intervals with riffs in the first half of the book and scales in the second half. It's sort of ridiculous actually that this even managed to get published. The title is extremely misleading and the concept of a 'Riff' that is presented here is not really what I think most other guitarists even consider it to be (most players I know think Riff == &quot;Rhythm Figure&quot;).Another HUGE problem: Technique is COMPLETELY ignored. Things like Palm Muting, Drone tones, Harmonics, etc, and their contribution to Riffery is completely lost in this book.The few examples that are presented in musical format are absolutely trivial (non copyrighted) things like the major scale intervals and patterns. Rooksby's Songwriting book is authored in exactly the same way... like some sort of bizarre muscic appreciation class that has nothing to do with actual guitar playing or composition.The companion &quot;CD&quot; takes the examples to the point of embarassment: With examples like &quot;let's play two notes a whole step apart&quot; and &quot;let's listen to someone play one position of the A pentatonic scale&quot;. Again: You can get past this point in the First Chapter of Guitar for Dummies or after two lessons with a competent instructor.Really this book would be funny if I had shoplifted it but the fact that I wasted hard earned cash just annoys me. Avoid this and Rooksby's Songwriting book like the plague. :(

A parallel which I haven't seen in other reviews here is the current 'alien invasion/x-files' obsession with the long running belief in alchemy. The same figures play roles.. the naive believer and the swindling fraud, most prominently.Our current astrology revival is only the latest wave of belief in this ancient 'art' and homeopathy has much in common with 'animal magnetism.'I think that every young person, every person should read it to gain an appreciation of the tools we have to sort out the sense from the nonsense as well as a historical perspective on how much human nature has not changed in its eagerness to believe in the face of reason.

Target AudienceIT professionals who need to learn about the Rational Unified Process (RUP)ContentsThis book is a relatively high-level overview of the entire RUP process.The book is divided into the following chapters: Software Development Best Practices; The Rational Unified Process; Static Structure: Process Description; Dynamic Structure: Iterative Development; An Architecture-Centric Process; A Use-Case-Driven Process; The Project Management Discipline; The Business Modeling Discipline; The Requirements Discipline; The Analysis and Design Discipline; The Implementation Discipline; The Test Discipline; The Configuration and Change Management Discipline; The Environment Discipline; The Deployment Discipline; Typical Iteration Plans; Implementing the Rational Unified Process; Summary of Roles; Summary of Artifacts; Acronyms; Glossary; Bibliography; IndexReviewThe Rational Unified Process, or RUP, is a software engineering methodology that attempts to map out and document all parts of a software development project. It's extremely comprehensive, but it's also adaptable to whatever level of effort is appropriate for your situation. This book, The Rational Unified Process - An Introduction, is a good start to begin your understanding of RUP.First off, let me say this is not an easy read. It's a good book with all the information you need to know to start using RUP, but the information is dense and highly detail oriented. Like most developers, I'm more oriented towards coding and testing. But realistically, you need to know what the system should do before you get to the coding piece. RUP helps to put all that into a formal framework so that the necessary things will get done in the proper order.While the entire RUP framework might feel overwhelming, the author makes sure to let you know that you can adapt the RUP to meet your situation. If you are adding a function to an existing system, you will be more focused on use cases, development, and deployment processes. The author does a good job in segmenting the information so that you can more easily focus on your needs.You should also not consider this the end-all volume on RUP that you will ever need. Kruchten doesn't try to detail specific techniques like use cases or UML. You will learn where they fit in to RUP, but you will need additional information on how to implement use cases or UML diagrams. Consider this the volume that allows you to place everything in a mental framework so that you can figure out what you will need to know going forward.ConclusionIf you are considering or in the process of implementing RUP, this is a book you should be studying. It's not an easy read, but it will give you the overview you need to understand the process and concepts.
912	362	\N	t	external	\N	3	0.0	A3AOWFFPS1NZZV	Christopher Mcfeely "Chris McFeely"	43	47	2006-10-16 03:52:38+08	It's no OHOTMU, but it does the job	In the style of their 2004 publication, "The DC Comics Encyclopedia," Dorling Kindersley have released "The Marvel Encyclopedia," a guide to the characters of the Marvel Comics universe. DK are no strangers to Marvel's universe, having frequently released "Ultimate Guide" books covering the histories of Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and next year, Ghost Rider. But how does this tome, touted as "the definitive guide," stack up?The sheer number of characters included is absolutely massive, with over 1000 separate entries for characters that span the past and present of the Marvel Universe, and even occupants of other dimensions, timelines and alternate universes (such as MC-2 characters like Spider-Girl, or occupants of the future of 2099). Each entry is headed with a table that provides a quick hit of info from the character's vital stats to their real names, first appearances and powers. The body of the entry provides an abbreviated origin and history for the character, bringing things up as recent as possible at the time of writing, and includes at least one image of the character. Standard entries are a paragraph long - of such a size that, barring larger pictures, about six can fit on a single page. At no time does such a thing occur, however, as entries range from being this size to quarter-page, half-page, full-page, and for the most notable characters and teams like Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, double-page spreads. Entries are signed with the initials of their writers - contributing Marvel editors Tom DeFalco and Tom Brevoort, X-Men: Ultimate Guide writer Peter Sanderson, and other scripters Michael Teitelbaum, Daniel Wallace and Andrew Darling, who have all contributed to other Dorling Kindersley comic guide books.The bulk of characters chosen for inclusion seem to have been fairly heavily based on the 1980's edition of Marvel's own guidebook publication, also written by Sanderson, "The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe," (leading to one or two odd naming conventions, such as the original Captain Marvel being listed as "Captain Mar-Vell") with more entries added for characters created since then. The range of characters is simply astounding, from the company's figureheads to hilariously obscure nobody do-nothings, which gives readers unfamiliar with the depth and breadth of the Marvel Universe a brilliantly expansive look at its past and present.For regular Marvelites, however, some choices are sure to be questioned - and since I am a Marvelite, here's a couple for ya. Why does Energizer, of kid-team Power Pack, get her own entry, while none of her team-mates do? Why does obscure Golden Age monster It, The Living Colossus, get an entry when the most famous of such creatures, Fin Fang Foom - active in comics as recent as six months ago - does not? Where is the entry for the biggest X-Men villain of recent years, Cassandra Nova? Why does major cosmic villain Thanos receive only a standard-size entry, while no-namers like Bi-Beast, Chemistro and Plant-Man get half a page? All those things said, however, this is very much the complaint of a man who might know a bit too much for his own good. I also own the DC Encyclopedia, and, as I know a lot less about that universe, so I can't make these complaints about it - but I guarantee that major DC fans will have said exactly the same thing about that book. It's a case, I feel, of being a little too close to the subject matter.What is certainly NOT a subjective issue, however, is the topic of errors. Such a publication will always be susceptible to mistakes, and more than are comfortable have crept into the finished product. With men such as DeFalco, Brevoort and Sanderson penning entries, one expects... well, perfection, frankly. These are chaps who know it all. And in fairness, the entries scripted by them are the best of the book. It is those by the other writers that have proven the weakest link. In fairness to all involved, however, there are very few outright ERRORS in the book - there are just instances of outdated information. For example, the Space Phantom's entry recounts his origin as an alien from the planet Phantos, which was retconned out as of 1998. The Mandarin and Blacklash are stated to be alive, when both have been dead for over half a decade. The Mole Man's real name is listed as "Unknown," when it has been known to be Harvey Rupert Elder for about eight years. Emma Frost's entry is probably the most embarrassing example of these - it only goes as far as her involvement with Generation X, neglecting to mention the fact that she has been a member of the X-Men for five years, is now romantically involved with Cyclops, and has acquired the power to transform into diamond.Then, there are the real mistakes, which are distinctly minimal, but present nonetheless, with the entry for "Warlock" being the worst example. In the Marvel Universe, there are two characters named "Warlock" - the genetically engineered cosmic hero ADAM Warlock, and the New Mutants ally and member of the alien race called the Technarcy. The entry for Warlock covers the former, but throughout the book, references to the Technarcy alien suggest that the Warlock entry is for him. Furthermore, both characters are connected to two separate characters known as "the Magus" - one is the evil future self of Adam Warlock, the other the father of the alien Warlock. The same error occurs - the article is about the alien father, but other articles indicate that it is about the evil future self.Outright mistakes most frequently come in the form of pictures, however - once in a blue moon, an entry is simply illustrated with an incorrect image. In most cases, you can understand the goof - for example, Aquarian's entry being illustrated with an image of Zodiac member Aquarius, Happy Hogan's entry picturing CRUSHER Hogan, or Nightshade's entry being paired with a picture of the OTHER character called Nightshade - but that doesn't excuse it. Warlock and the Magus's errors are compounded further by these - although the man illustration of Warlock's entry is right, an inset image depicts the alien Warlock, while the Magus's entry is completely screwed up, being decorated with a picture of neither alien nor future self, but DOC MAGUS, a completely unrelated character from Spider-Girl's universe!!With DeFalco as Consultant Editor, I have no doubt that most if not all of these mistakes would have been caught had there been a little more time for production, but it seems very much as though the book has been released now to get it out in time for Christmas, and to in turn capitalise on the current bout of high profile popularity Marvel is undergoing thanks to their huge Civil War crossover event.But seriously, folks - in spite of the flubs I have noted here, please, please remember that for every one entry that slips up, SCORES more are spot-on perfect.

I've read his Incarnation of Immortality series, all the Xanth books, the Mode books, and the Apprentice Adept series. But this, I have to say, is the best of the bunch. What do you get when you cross a young black Mundane with a magical talent, a 130 year old man who was transformed into a tree, three kings, and a mess of zombies? Believe it or not, one of the best surprises to come into Xanth in years, thanks to the devious plotting of Good Magician Humphrey, Clio the Muse, and everybody's favorite elf, Jenny of the World of Two Moons. For all of us raised on fairy tales, this one beats them all.

There is no such thing as a bad commentary by Pink. I own 90% of his published writings and in my opinion this is his best work. The Hebrew writer (which Pink makes the best argument I've heard for Paul's authorship) intended for this epistle to show the physical things of the Old Testament as a shadow of the spiritual things in the New Testament. Pink masterfully follows this theme! Mission accomplished! This is definitely written at a college-reading level and a &quot;must read&quot; for every minister who has put his faith in Jesus the Christ.

The author discusses the U.S. effort to overthrow Congo's leader Patrice Lumumba in 1960, because he was too independent. The West wouldn't help him suppress a rebellion in Katanga province sponsored by Belgian mining interests, so Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for aid. The U.S then had an excuse to get rid of him. Mamdani shows how the mercenaries the U.S. used to crush a Lumumbaist rebellion in Kivu province in 1964-65 committed horrible atrocities.. Then Lumumba's killer General Mobutu seized power and ravaged and looted the country with Western aid.The author notes that the U.S. and South African backed rebels in Angola,UNITA, were cited by Africas Watch as being behind the planting of the landmines that made Angola one of the amputee capitals of the world, laying siege to villages to starve civilians, kidnapping, and so on. This was another example of the U.S. opposing "ultra-nationalist regimes" that had to turn to the Cubans for aid. He shows how the U.S. encouraging of South Africa 's aggression against its neighbors undermined moderate tendencies in it and set back the end of apartheid. A State Department report concluded that the South African backed Renamo guerillas, which was supported by Bob Dole and the Heritage Foundation., were responsible for 95 percent of the atrocities in Mozambique's barbaric civil war. South Africa heavily invested in the U.S. media and Jerry Falwell.He discusses the libertarian tradition of Islam, i that allows for a participatory democratic and modernized "Itjihad" to interpret Sharia law. He shows how little jihad as "holy war" was part of the Islamic tradition before the Afghan war.He notes the U.S. began aiding the Mujahadeen at least six months before the Russians invaded. In March 1985, the immortal Reagan compared them, the Mujahadeen, to our founding fathers.. The CIA approved the Saudi selection of Bin Laden as leader of the "Arab Afghans" and gave him the contract to build the Khost tunnel complex. Training of trainers for Pakistan's mujahadeen camps took place in many bases in the U.S. The majority of U.S. aid went not to the most viable political and military Afghan groups but to Gullubdin Heckmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami.. Heckmatyar had during his younger days led mobs in throwing acid in the faces of women not wearing the veil. The CIA liked Heckmatyar's warriors because they were the most brutal. Pakistan's dictator General Zia and its ISI gave him control of Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and he ruled them with murder and violence. He operated heroin factories just inside Pakistan, in Southern Helmand,. In 1988-89, Heckmatyar' and another Mujahadeen leader who enjoyed castrating landowners who refused to grow opium for him, fought the largest battle of the whole anti-Soviet war not against the Russians but each other for control of the opium growing and heroin processing business in the Helmand valley. Afghan war related CIA assets like Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and Ramzi Yousef went on to many infamies including the WTC bombing in 1993 (he notes the trouble that an FBI regional director got into for pointing this out). The CIA sponsored recruitment tours of the U.S. conducted by Sheikh Abdul Azzam, a founder of Hamas and Al Qaida. Today Pakistan produces 75 percent of the world's heroin., whereas before 1979 it produced almost none.The DEA was instructed to ignore Pakistan's facilitation of the Mujahadeen heroin trade. The CIA Afghan operations head later said that the CIA should have to apologize for all this. The author should have noted that U.S. forces have recently been trying to assassinate Heckmatyar. The author goes over the previous CIA facilitation of the drug trade in France, Burma and Laos.The CIA worked with military officers from the fascist regime in Argentina and Israel in order to support the Contras in their early years, which were made up of right wing politicians and military officers formerly allied with the barbarian dictator Somoza, as even some U.S. funded Contra leaders like Arturo Cruz began to complain. Israel as proxy for the U.S. had supplied Somoza with 98 percent of his weapon in the last horrific months of his rule. Former CIA analyst David MCMichael testified that the U.S. hoped by Contra terror to provoke the Sandanistas to various atrocities to get ammunition to use against them.Mamdani quotes Oliver North's notebook and the infamous 1985 CIA training manual about how U.S. backed Contra terror hoped to destroy Nicaragua's economy and make the people of the country loose faith in the ability of the Sandinistas to provide security. The Notebook also quoted reports by North's aide Robert Owen of drug running by Contra leaders. The biggest evidence is provided by the 1998 report of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz. Despite Hitz's denials to the contrary the fine print of Volume 2 of the report revealed the CIA had worked with 58 drug running Contra officials and allied with the powerful Caribbean drug lord, Alan Hyde. The report also revealed that CIA director William Casey had made a deal in 1982 with the Justice Dept. that allowed the CIA not to report any drug dealings by its non-official employees.He points out how the U.S. deliberately destroyed Iraq's infrastructure necessary for the maintenance of civilian life during Gulf War I, a war crime, then blocked Iraqi repairs of such things as water treatment plants on ridiculous grounds, causing horrible epidemics. It's use of depleted uranium weapons in 91' and 03 has killed hundreds of thousands of children and infected U.S. troops with "the Gulf War Syndrome." The U.S., after Rumsfeld's 1983-84 visits with Saddam, massively helped Saddam get materials for his WMD arsenal, and protected his gassing of Kurds from UN scrutiny. The U.S. then kept Saddam in power after Gulf War I, as the author quotes Thomas Friedman of the NYT. He notes the Shendon PR firm, the facilitators of the bogus baby incubator story back in 1990 was placed on contract in early 2002 by Rumsfeld's OSI.

Christian parents will be pleased to discover that while magic is a recurring theme in this book, it proves to be mearly a side story to the more important and intreguing prospect of William's character development. I recomend to any parent this book for their young son. It speaks of Honor and Chivalry in the face of evil, of strength and tender souls. What this book speaks of in regard to emotional strength is something that every child, and even adult, needs to discover; That to Cry is not Cowardice, to be tender hearted is not Weakness, and that Honor and courage is the Heart of a Knight.

This book was thoroughly entertaining.I laughed out loud on several occasions which caused people to inquire about the book. This book was better than I expected. I don't think I've come across a more appropriate title in a long time. Although it seems like more than hell broke loose.Despite having predictable points, the plot was well developed. I did not expect for the plot to unfold as it did. While the Alston family first appeared to be a simple family, you soon learned that life had made them all quite complex. Greg, the central character, was an interesting man-caring, sensitive, intelligent, and bitter. His relationships with his family, friends, and fiancee often led him--particularly the women in his life. Although Greg was this intelligent man, I'm puzzled as to why he didn't fiugre out certain things about Adrian.I understand the significance of exploring Greg's friendships, I could have done without Phil. The ignorance of this friend and his lack of respect for women, was too over the top at times.Shreese was probably the most interesting character in this book because it was hard to believe that she was as simple/naive as she was. At first she seemed nothing more than a &quot;Holy Roller&quot;. Although things about Shreese were simple, her reasons for being were deep rooted in pain. Camika Spencer is a great storyteller, I'm looking forward to futher works from this author.

Freud was one of the first, and one of the most brilliant, psychologists to attempt a `scientific' study of the mind. Freud attempted to explain and understand the dynamics of the psyche, not through mere casual observation or personal introspection, but through clinical experience. There are many scientists and philosophers, Karl Popper being the most famous, who have attacked Freud for being `unscientific' in method and for failing the test of falsifiability in his conclusions.It must be admitted that any attempt to study the mind using the methods of objective science is going to run into some serious epistemological hurdles; hurdles that still have not been entirely overcome to this day. These epistemological questions are important questions and should be taken seriously. But in my opinion the people who are busy picking apart Freud's theories to see whether they are `scientific', or whether they measure up to some preconceived notion of what a scientific theory should be, are asking the wrong questions. The question that should be asked is: have Freud's theories and writings increased our understanding of the nature and the dynamics of the human mind? The obvious answer to that question, in my opinion, is yes.The Interpretation of Dreams is Freud's attempt to understand the nature and dynamics of dreaming. We all take for granted the fact that we dream, but few of us ever truly begin to wonder at how strange a fact that is; and even of those of us who do only a few will go on and attempt to understand why we dream in any serious way. There were people who attempted to understand dreaming before Freud but Freud has come to tower above them in the same way that Adam Smith has come to tower above all the economists who came before him and probably for good reason.Freud puts forward some fairly counter-intuitive thesis in regard to dreaming. The first is that all dreaming is wish-fulfillment. This is the kind of claim that seems to fly in the face of empirical evidence, as well as our everyday understanding of the nature of dreams. I am not going to attempt to enter the debate in regard to whether Freud was right in this conclusion but it should be pointed out that this was a conclusion Freud was led to in his clinical experience, and the obvious objections to this theory (the existence of anxiety dreams for instance) were objections that Freud was well aware of and Freud deals with them directly in this book.The real meat of the book, in my opinion, is Freud's attempt to analyze the psychological processes that give rise to dreams. The fact that Freud begins with a counter-intuitive hypothesis, namely, that all dreams are wish-fulfillments, requires him to undertake the task of explaining how (and why) these wishes take the form of dreams as we know them. Dreams certainly do not appear to us to be wish-fulfillments. Freud has to explain why dreams do not appear on the surface to be wish-fulfillments and this requires him to work out a theory of psychic functioning which will adequately explain how dreams are formed.This ultimately is the reason why I say that Freud was one of the first to attempt a scientific study of the mind whether his theories measure up to the philosopher of science's standards or not. Freud's method is entirely different from the person who simply attempts to describe the nature of dreams by describing their pictorial form, their logical incongruities, etc. Freud puts forward an hypothesis and this hypothesis leads him to some new and startling conclusions about psychic functioning which would not be immediately obvious to a person merely engaged in casual introspection.In order to explain the form dreams take Freud first makes a distinction between the manifest and latent content of a dream. This is probably the central notion behind the whole book, and the reason, in Freud's opinion, that no one had succeeded in understanding dreams before him was because no one was able to make this distinction. Attempts to understand dreams before Freud focused all of their attention on a dream's manifest content. The latent content of a dream can only be discovered in the analytic situation by allowing the patient to free-associate in regard to different elements of the dream. Through this method one is able to discover the latent thoughts behind the creation of the dream.The dream is formed by a number of processes operating on these latent thoughts. One of the processes is condensation in which elements from the dream-thoughts are combined and condensed into a single manifest content. Another process is that of displacement in which psychic values are transferred between contents. The dream also has to deal with the problem of representability which Freud deals with extensively.There are a number of aspects of Freud's work which seem slightly primitive when reading him today. Freud was well aware that he was heading out into new territory and that many of his theories would have to be revised in the future as we learned more. But a person can still learn a great deal about the functioning of the psyche from reading this book, and not just about the formation of dreams. Freud's theory of dreams (as well as his theories on neurosis which are not dealt with directly in this book) required Freud to re-evaluate the nature of the human mind. He presents a new schematic of the mind and how it functions in the final chapter of the book. While some of this does seem slightly primitive today it cannot be denied that Freud's theories have profoundly altered our understanding of what it means to be human. No one who is interested in that question should skip this book (or Freud's other works).

Dr. Laings book, Knots, illustrates in terms we can easily understand the unusual complexities of human relationships, particularly involving loving or not loving. With apparent child-like simplicity Dr. Laing demonstrates for us what is intuitively complex and daunting. He clarifies what for us is emotional and psychological, using the knot as a metaphore for what we want to see about our relationships that is clouded and only vaguely sensed. To clarify is to confirm. To make visible what is troubling is to give the reader respect for their intuition and possibly even a grasp of how to deal with our relations with each otherl. The power of understanding our relating to others is here in a short text from which we can begin to unknot our mental perplexity and achieve for ourselves satisfying or at the very least, understood, relations with those we love.

Crime was rampant, every union went on strike every other week, and the threat of fiscal calamity was ever present. At its darkest moment, when &quot;Ford to New York: Drop Dead&quot; hit the headline, something astonishing exploded from NBC studios: Saturday Night Live. Somehow this one show made urban life a little more bearable, and a television legacy was born. And, somehow, New York had saved itself.Authors James Miller and Tom Shales collected nearly thirty years worth of quotes and interviews, and amassed them in this terrific book, &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot;. For a hefty volume (over 600 pages), the book is a very quick read. While a good deal of time is spent honoring the deceased cast members, the tone never gets maudlin nor nostalgic. In fact, it was refreshing to remember some of Belushi's, Radner's, and Hartman's antics. Not surprising, drugs and ego clashes abounded. Talent + money + 1970s = celebrities on controlled substances, after all. What was interesting were the comments by the guests. Buck Henry has a great story, but I won't give it away here. &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot; is a fascinating look at one of the bright moments in an otherwise dark milieu.

As a self-appointed knitting-reject, i thought i would give this book ago, having enjoyed moderate success with a crochet hook in the past...I absolutely love this book!The instructions for crochet were easy to read and understand, (I made myself go through the basics again first), and i am now on my third project 'inspired by' and adapted from one in the book.It is a fun and inspiring book, and having already had a peek at Ms Stoller's Knitting Stitch'N'Bitch books which also have a load of things i want to make, i may have to bite the bullet and re-learn the art of Knitting too....Reading some of the reviews i have seen some 'issues' with mistakes made within the book, but i think that once you get 'into' it, you will start to go with your own flow and look and the patterns alot less, or have the confidence to wing it on your own anyway!

But I was interested in the author because of his reputation as a great, influential theologian. I found this book a very boring, difficult read with tons of repetition, not just in concepts but even within sentences and paragraphs. It was written several decades ago and perhaps for those who are interested in the history of existentialism there are pluses to the book. The best chapter, in my opinion, was the last chapter (6) where Tillich explores "Courage and Transcendence". More specifically, I liked the last subchapter on "Theism Transcended". This section contained timeless concepts of what theism means and doesn't mean, and an astute observation that one definition of theism is an empty one used by politicians who throw out the word "God" in speeches to impress their audiences with their moral trustworthiness. In that respect, the book was "current" and certainly applicable to the recently concluded Republican presidential candidate primary race. But in the end, I didn't feel my time slogging through this book was time well spent.

I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the ship's past, crew, passengers, story, myths, route, disaster, and capivating spells. People also interested in space exploration will find this book fascinating. Charles Pellegrino did a phenomenal job in paralleling inner space, and outer space.In &quot;Her Name, Titanic&quot; we are invited onboard, to explore the ship at our leisure, on the surface, as well as on the ocean floor. We share the passenger's experiences during the time of disaster, and are able to envision the Titanic's last few minutes during her maiden voyage.It is a well written piece, and contains the ability to take the reader into a lifeboat, granting us permission to hear the cries of disbelief, fear, and shock, over the ocean's surface that dreadful night. With Pellegrino's descriptive words, and use of metaphors, the readers are able to observe the bodies floating helplessly in the North Atlantic, and feel the life-saving grips of survivors on the edges of lifeboats pulling them to safety. Readers can feel the ice-chilled water temperatures, and the chill in the air biting at their bodies, while turning from page to page.This book envelopes the reader completely, as the ocean enveloped the Titanic itself. I found it an entertaining peice, as well as a tragic peice. A piece written in truth, as well as misery.The Titanic has held thousands of people under Her spell, for almost a hundred years, myself included. Reading this book, you will discover some of the reasons why, if you have not encountered them yet. Run, don't walk, to the nearest bookstore, or library, and read this story. Enjoy...

As another reviewer mentioned , this is not a book for the layman. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math.

It's not really rocket science, and, in an age of plenty, it's not really about scarcity. It's about individuals making choices to maximize value. They may be bad choices, uniformed choices or perverse choices, but they have, in the final analysis, impact limited to the individual. And in most cases result in some level of increased individual satisfaction.The real danger, according to Hazlitt, is when the choices of a few people, with same kinds of fallacies noted above, are coercive, enforced by government or monopolies. Which leads us to to the negative reviews.The negatives, if we can be allowed to throw out the obvious loser rants, seem to be concerned mainly with rapacious corporations, free trade among inequal countries and natural monopolies. While these are certainly provide distortions of individual choice and informed consent, they do in the long run tend to be self correcting -- see government-sanctioned coal and oil monopolies. The real interest is in how to minimize the effects of these diseconomies.Hazlitt would argue that they are self-correcting via the collective effect of individual choices. The Marxists would argue that action based upon the sceeding of individual choice to a collective power is the solution. Surely, if we can assume there is no absolute, theoretical winner in this debate, we can look to the real world, based upon the actions of multiple forms of government and millions of individuals to provide some guidance on which path leads to the most for the most.To that end, I would challenge you to read Hazlitt's book and a Marxist equivalent like Ivan Ilich's &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and then, accepting both as plausibly complete and material, match them against your experience of recent history and your hopes for your personal future.

The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe's way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself.The reasons for this book's immediate &quot;classic&quot; status are easy to pick: totally accurate citing of hundreds of never-before-used sources in several languages drawn from major archives; a highly original approach to the writing of campaign histories; a clear argument; a fair and balanced approach; no Wehrmacht-devotee comments or tone (all too common I'm afraid); a wonderfully readable writing style; and precise footnotes that help the reader to determine the reliability of all claims or statements.A true model of a WWII campaign analysis.

The terms good and bad are quasi-official names for those who support and oppose American foreign policy, and therefore, they are political in nature. It is precisely in explaining the root of political concerns behind the labels that this book comes into its markets and readers. In spite of the author's ambiguity about the audience of this book and the fact that this book seems overwhelm with irrelevant materials, it is still worth reading as a political memoir of an intellectual with roots in the Muslim world and the benefit of a Harvard education, and with residences both in New York and in Kampala, Uganda. Mamdani mourns the fate of Muslims who are not only unable to find a way out of the shackles of modernity, but who are also unable to define their own identity and therefore have become the objects of others and defined as either bad or good. Muslims, unless they can prove that they are `good,' are collectively assumed to be bad. Perhaps the enthusiasm to prove that not all Muslims are bad, Mamdani convinced to dig into the historical setting of the emergence of political Islam during the Cold War and the political sequences that shaped this era. By introducing all this information, Mamdani tries to explain to Muslims their current situations and the system of knowledge by which they are identified. More over the entire contents of this book reflects the need for Muslims to think critically, not just to echo or to condemn the labels of good or bad. Muslims in this sense also must be able to criticize their own situation today. In addition this book also reminds the American power elite that "the world has changed, that the old colonialism is no more and will not return," and "that to occupy foreign places will be expensive, in lives and money" (260). Mamdani turns off his sermon by saying that America must learn how to live in the world and he forgets to remind the Islamists how to live in the world in peace with others.

The author heightens intellect with urban intellect (intellect with street smarts or what is referred to as common sense). However, the drama is what kept me interested in reading this book. At times I felt as if the author's political views were contradictory and confusing until the lessons at the end of the book. Although I understand the authors reasoning for writing the literature in this form, I believe that the form that was utilized can easily distance a reader from completing the book. Overall, I admire how Ms. Souljah demonstrates the effects politics joined with racism has on everyday life for African Americans and Caucasians.

I have been dancing for 15 years now, and this is still one of my favorite books. I was introduced to it when I was about 5 and it facinated me. The whole story seemed true to what I knew about ballet and Stephanie, the main character, lived my biggest dreams! For years, I only borrowed it from the library, and soon it was one of the most worn in their collection! Finally, we moved away and the next library didn't have it, but Mom found it at a used book store and bought it for me. I ended up meeting David Richards, a teacher in the book, at a ballet competition and he signed it for me. He told me that Stephanie doesn't dance any more, and I don't think she ever made it into New York City Ballet company or any other ballet company. Like I said earlier, I've been dancing 15 years and this book, to me, is even more a true embodiment of what the every-day life of a ballet dancer is! I've known this book so long that I can quote it forwards and backwards, and almest every sentence is or has been true for me! I just finished a run of Nutcracker and, "I tore a little pink ribbon off the pantaloons that I wore in the party scene to keep for a souvenir."-to quote page 118.

I remember howWatchmenimpressed me most with the after-comic additions like the autobiography of the one character and interviews. I found the series less interesting when it switched to the main storyline. With Promethea, his storytelling ability is much better syncronized with his intellectual aesthetic.Beginning the series with a bogus biography of the character, he sets up his tricks from the beginning and its still fun watching them. The character of Promethea is both a reality and a story and part of the main imagination. The character becomes more prominent when someone writes about her. Or draws her. She takes on the aspect of the era and the writing. The 18th century poet creates a bathic love type of Promethea and he begins an affair with his maid who has taken on Promethea. In the early 20th century, a children's cartoonist becomes Promethea and she saves the soldiers of the Great War. The Pulp Fiction version of Promethea is both a sexist fantasy and a platform to mock the inherent sexism of male dominated literature ("do your breasts ever heave" she says at one point and at another Alan Moore name checks Helen Cixious).This is an amazing series that wraps around itself and celebrates literature while creating its own thing. I love how he does it in LXG, but I dare say that this might be better executed.

The result is woefully narrow; the book could have been called GENIUS AS MARGINALITY: PROBLEMS IN THE MARKETING OF RICHARD THOMPSON. To make matters worse, Humphries has a weak grasp of the difference between achievement and reception: the reader who wants to know which albums to buy will find that she is only told which ones have been well-received.(Clive Gregson: "I don't believe that Richard has ever really been that bothered about making records. It's not the real thing for him.")Yet there are interesting quotes here, both from the articulate Thompson and from his perceptive wives, friends, colleagues, and critics.

Background:I am a graduate student of energy economics and international business in one of the most important oil cities in the world. I have devoted the past four years to understand energy at all levels of society, especially in developing economies. If you don't want to read the entire review, skip to the end for the conclusions.My review:Mr. Klare tries very hard to paint a malodorous picture of America's dependence on oil by implying that through war and terrorism American oil policy costs lives. No data is given about how many lives were lost as a result of oil-related conflicts. This leaves the reader to wonder just how many lives are lost relative to other causes of death such as `infectious diseases' or `genocide.'My largest complaint about the book is that the author only devotes two paragraphs to economic opportunity cost (p. 11, and 24-25). I feel that the author would have made a much more compelling argument by actually adding up the transfers U.S. of wealth, U.S. military costs, and the costs of U.S. aid to nations that we only deal with because they have oil. This would help illustrate his argument that the real cost of oil makes us realize that we are making unsound economic choices. However, money isn't blood, and the author is after blood (especially the blood of "Vice-President Cheney and his cronies. (p. 198)")He attempts to indict the Bush Administration for getting into bed with unsavory politicians for the sake of securing oil. However, given his own history that charts oil dependence from FDR to GWB one is hard pressed to see how the result could have been any other way. He also does very little to criticize the Clinton Administration, who had 8 years to address our energy issues but willfully choose to ignore them.The author tries very hard to incriminate the Bush administration for failing in the specter of Foreign Policy by not advocating consumption, yet his arguments are incomplete. The author does nothing to address the social, economic, or environmental virtues of conservation. Perhaps he does so because scholars agree that increased efficiency without viable alternative sources of energy results in increased consumption, thus rendering his "fork in the road" really a circuitous route to the same end (Simil 2003 p. 320). The author then resorts to ad-hominem attacks on those who crafted the policy. He even picked up on the same trick that Paul Roberts uses: evoking the name of Enron whenever you wanted to cast suspicion on someone (or something). In the end, he beats up increased consumption while skirting the benefits of conservation or facing the reality that alternative energy sources (especially in transportation) are not ready for mass deployment (Simil 2003 ch. 6) . Are we to simply assume that conservation has no net negative effects? For the purposes of making his case, the author certainly thinks so.On page 176-77, the author has a table enumerating arms transfers to Middle Eastern states. It is interesting that Europe accounts for the majority of those transfers, while the United States accounts for about 40%. Granted, Europe is not one, but several nations and as individual nations they cannot exert the same kind of force that the United States alone can. However, since these arms undoubtedly came from nations that have arms technology to sell (France, Germany, UK, and perhaps even the former Soviet Bloc nations) I find it interesting that Klare never explored the geo-political implications of these transfers.Klare skirts the issue that the developing petro-states are prone to socio-political conflict because they do not have the institutions to promote a successful democracy, let alone capitalism. Since we are measuring in terms of blood, instead of money, I bet if one were to actually tally the body count of modern socio-political conflict from a lack of institutions it would make the modern oil security body count look very small.To be fair, the author does "brainstorm" a tepid solution that most lay people would understand. However, considering how carefully the author researched and crafted his case against the Bush Administration, one is left disappointed that he refuses to give the same level of care to solving the problems he so eagerly points out leaving one to really wonder "Is this a John Kerry campaign speech?" Given the timing that the book was released and given that Klare wrote several favorable articles about John Kerry during the campaign, it is not a difficult mental exercise to make that connection.Conclusion:If you want to read a book about how horrible the Bush Administration and how we are all going to heck in a handbasket because of Big Oil and their cronies in the White House, this is the book for you. I would also read Paul Roberts' nearly hysterical (and factually questionable) The End of Oil as a companion to this book.However, if you want meaningful analysis and thoughtful energy policy suggestions, this is not the book for you. For survey primer on the state of energy affairs today Vaclav Simil's Energy At the Crossroads paints a fine picture, and you can agree or disagree with his conclusions. As a history, Daniel Yergin's The Prize is the definitive resource. I have not yet read a book on energy policy that I can recommend.

When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and "show" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!

He takes us step-by-step through the trials and tribulations of getting a Broadway musical through the rehearsal process, having obviously kept copious notes throughout. The fact that both Hal Prince and Stephen Sondheim read the manuscript and &quot;...offered helpful corrections and suggestions&quot; adds to the authenticity of the work. He doesn't overly glamorize the people involved, nor is it simply backstage gossip. We are taken through the many steps that are involved in putting up a huge Broadway musical, including helpful details of jobs that many people are not aware of, including music copying, orchestration, set design and construction, lighting, sound, costumes... and the people who try to keep them all together and created the finished masterpiece that is &quot;Follies.&quot; I hate to sound trite, but I couldn't put it down!

My uncle gave me this book in hardback when it first came out in 1991 because Feiler is from his hometown of Savannah, Georgia. I'm glad to see it's still in print in paperback because it's a classic that anyone interested in Japanese culture should read.Feiler begins his book by bravely stating, "I dropped my pants and felt a rush of cool wind against my legs." He's standing on a stone path in the cool of evening his first night out of Tokyo. Twelve sets of eyes peer curiously at him, whom we learn are his new co-workers in the school where he's teaching. Yes, this is quite a bit of culture shock. Whereas in the states, a new teacher might be taken to a luncheon, Feiler says, "As a newcomer in Japan, I would be welcomed into my office as I was welcomed into the world: with a bare body and a fresh bath."The author's sense of humor is evident throughout the book, and he spices up a tremendous volume of research with his engaging narrative. Since he's encountering everything for the first time, he describes his reactions in a way that helps initiate readers into Japan's fascinating and unique culture.I found it amazing that Feiler could experience so much in one year. For example, he breaks his ankle and must visit a hospital, which makes one understand why studying the Japanese language before embarking can come in handy. (Feiler appears to be fluent; did he learn that at Yale?) He attends sports day, field trips, city and small-town events, a wedding, and of course, the climactic journey up Mt. Fuji.Feiler's trip up Mt. Fuji was my favorite part of the book, and something I longed to do when I visited the Tokyo area -- yet I traveled mid-peak by car instead of on foot. When the author finally makes it to the top, he describes his view for us armchair travelers: "Standing on an isolated spot atop this ancient volcano, far removed from the crowds of Tokyo...we popped open our bottle of imported champagne and beheld the sight that has inspired a nation since the gods of heaven first descended the bridge to the Land of the Central Plain: the caress of the Rising Sun." (This ancient myth is explained in detail in the book.)If you're planning on going to teach or travel in Japan, Feiler's work is a must-read; for no other reason, it will whet your appetite for writing down your own experiences (yes, he must have carried a notebook everywhere he went!). But you definitely should read more recent literature written by other travelers, as well as by native Japanese. I also recommend a good basic Nihongo course, so you'll be able to navigate the train systems in case you journey outside of the major cities. Or if by chance you end up in the hospital with a broken something or other.--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester

When I first read it I was drawn in by the opening chapter, in which the authors describe how Southern pro-slavery writers linked abolition to miscegenation, free love and communism, and how the South hoped to introduce slavery into the north and the territories. The authors point out that slave labor was one of the obstacles to the progress of free laborers. One of the most important themes of this book is that the issues of race and of commumism have been used to divide workers and prevent them from organizing. The book was co-written by an historian and an attorney for the United Electrical Workers (UEW), which was broken up by the federal government because of alleged communist influence. The writers are not afraid of the issue of socialism and communism and accuse the government of thought control, referring to laws that were passed in the 1950's against communist influence in labor unions (and in every area of political life). I have seen criticisms of this work which claim that it is biased and inaccurate, siding in many matters of historical controversy, such as the Sacco-Vanzetti case, the Molly Maguires, and the Haymarket bombings, with the labor point of view and ignoring contrary evidence. In fact it is lively and stimulating reading, and does illuminate parts of our history that aren't much written of. I think its historical accuracy holds up pretty well. Our political life has been in a sense neutered, since the 1950's, by the insistence of the government on driving the very mention of socialism from the realms of political respectability. We are the poorer for this. I recommend this book and I. F. Stone's The Haunted Fifties and a Glance at the Startling Sixties to those who really want a good account of a dissenting view, one that has nearly vanished from public discourse.

Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.

Finding books that appeal to more than one grade level is a challenge.I have found that the pictures in this version of 'Puss' appeal immensely to kindergartners through third graders. (Fourth and Fifth grade children also like it, but are often embarassed to say so in a classroom setting!). Children who often have a hard time sitting still for a story have sat transfixed as I read this book, holding the pictures in front of them all the time and giving them lots of opportunities to check out the wonderful use of light and color. The illustrator uses a lot of wonderful yellow that is very appealing to young children and seems to draw them into the book. I love reading this book out loud both to see children's reaction and also because I love the detail and color in the pictures.Reading this book aloud has also sparked some beautiful art work from young children.

THough I'm more familier with the marvel universe it seemed the DC encyclopedia was more up to date with fewer clerical errors such as mislabeled pictures. Also the entries in the DC encyclopedia were more comprehensive which on comparison of the two I realized was because it had smaller print allowing more information. So really the Marvel Encyclopedia is good for a reader that doesn't have a huge body of knowledge of the MU but readers looking for an encyclopedia as well put together as the DC encyclopedia will be dissapointed which is sad since contributing writers were greats like Tom Defalco, Tom Brevoort, and Peter Sanderson.

"Sour grapes" may also be driving such writing as has appeared in the last 2 books Phillips has produced, as the current conservatives controlling the country exclude the traditional conservatives that refuse to shut up and go by the new rules. Does that mean that his points are any less valid?..of course not.For some, this will be an eye-opener, for others it will provide reinforced arguments in support of circumstances that have already been identified.Either way---enjoy.

Then think about all the mythology flowing through her adventures. Then stop and let Alan Moore show you how it's done.Moore marks his return to deconstructionist super-hero comics with this gorgeous, often brilliant series. While even the most diligent reader is likely to get a little lost as the star of comic learns about the legends of Promethea while taking on her mantle, the journey - at least at the beginning of this series - is truly worth it. Moore, helped by the team of Williams and Gray, forges a stunning futuristic but believable world, creates a diverse and likeable cast, and has a lot of fun.These issues are Promethea went it was still brilliant, before Moore's penchant for injecting his own religious and philosophical views into this book made later issues hard reading. But for fans who missed the Alan Moore of V for Vendetta and Watchmen, this is must reading. For fans of Wonder Woman who long for more than just action tales, this is must reading. And for fans of great art with women as real as they are sexy, you can't go wrong either.

As Korzybski noted, all human beings form a view of so-called 'reality'. Understanding how scientists do this can have value for the rest of us. In this excellent book, the authors emphasize general formulations and a non-mathematical approach: "Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone" (29). The book includes chapters on "The Rise of the Mechanical View," "The Decline of the Mechanical View," "Field, Relativity," and "Quanta." Readers will be rewarded with clear explanations of some potentially forbidding notions. These are interspersed with useful comments on physico-mathematical method, theory and the goals of science. Einstein's and Infeld's discussion demonstrates their view that "Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense impressions. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is whether and in what way our theories form such a link" (310).

Much, if not all of the problems we face today, and the scares and scams are the result of either the misuses of science data and people or the forced ignoring of scientific truths. Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense Against Health Scares and Scams by Steven J. Milloy, is a good start but falls short of all the facts, and most of all, how to turn the tide toward truth. If you are concerned about this subject, read the book but spend the least to acquire it, i.e., buy it as a gift, then read it before giving it away. At least you will get double duty out of money spent. If you are really concerned about this subject, do your research well beyond the books meager coverage, then get involved at the local and state political levels. Keep in mind, if you choose to take such a path that you will come head-on with environmental terrorists such as the lawyers of the Sierra Club, Green Peace, and the likes of others who have perverted the path. The path is a good one, but it is now greatly abused by such groups. Again, the book Junk Science is a `light' start on the subject-an eye opener if you will-that falls short on how to personally make a difference.

I thought his history of anxiety, starting with the Stoics (&quot;the only real alternative to Christianity in the Western world&quot;) was remarkable (though at times a rough read). Influenced by Heidegger and Kierkegaard(&quot;to confront his existence alone&quot;) he drives on to the inevitable search for God. For Tillich, the &quot;Courage to Be" is partly the courage to despair, and avoid the &quot;Neurosis is a away of avoiding non-being by avoiding being&quot;. He is also influenced by Freud and psychoanalysis (called &quot;depth psychology&quot; in the book), which in our day of Prozac and behavioral psychology is refreshing.The nature of the discussions, being, nonbeing, subjectivity, objectivity make for difficult reading with double negatives (eg. &quot;Nonbeing is no threat because finite being is, in the last analysis, nonbeing&quot;). If one can wade through the language, there a lot of insight.

This looks like a possible newer edition, but that would only mean an already outstanding book must now be superb. A book is only as good as its author, and Peter Urban is an excellent writer who captures the essence of karate and the "traditional" karate lifestyle (think "old school") with his personal experiences, anecdotes and special section of classic & entertaining martial art folk tales. The book's title is spot on and really sums it up in a nutshell: "Traditions and Tales of a martial art." Again, this is NOT an instructional or how-to book, but more akin to a writer's (martial artist's) journal or diary. It's an easy & fun read. No matter what style/art you study, how long you've been studying, or if you're someone who just likes martial arts in general (whether you take the arts or not), I think you'll LOVE this well-written & fascinating book.

The author eschews traditional structure for her own cockamamie ideas about how to write a screenplay. For example, she claims that what you write about should be informed by your age and gender. So, if the screenwriter is a female in her early twenties:"chances are your relationship with your father includes the car. This is often the way father-daughter relationships get worked out. You call him when your car breaks down. It breaks down a lot or if it's new your father helps with the payments..."What in the world is the author talking about?! Girls in their twenties should write about whatever they want to write about! I mean, think of your favorite movie. Now imagine the screenwriter sitting down and thinking, "based on my age and gender, I should probably write a story about..." It's probably the worst advice I've ever heard regarding writing a screenplay.And, the irony is that she claims structure just gets in the way of a first draft. So forget about planning or any kind of outline, but... if you're:"In your early thirties you will have a theme involving your relationship with your mother or father." ... "Notice if you're writing a murder mystery. You are extremely angry at your parent and your movie is a way to express that anger."So, to recap... don't think about or plan your screenplay, but if you're thirty, better write something about your parents, and if it's a murder mystery, note that you're angry at them. Then, after you've wasted hours and hours totally disregarding story structure, go back and try to shoehorn a movie into the ensuing mess.I'm sorry, but this is not a serious book. And unsurprisingly, the author has no produced screenplays credited on IMDB. I'm shocked by the positive reviews for this book. To me it wreaks of snake-oil for novices who get suckered by the 21 days premise.That said, there is one idea in the book that I agree with - and it is hardly original: if you want to be a writer, write. That's it. All of the other nonsensical, counterproductive claptrap the author makes up is a waste of time - unless of course, it gets you to sit down and write. I believe that if you write for three hours a day, as the book suggests, you will learn IN SPITE of all the other bogus she gets into. I also believe that if a total novice practiced violin for three hours a day with no instruction, after 21 days they'd be a lot better. Nobody would hire them, or even want to listen, but there would be improvement. Same with brain surgery. Hey, there's an idea for a book!My advice, buy a book that goes over traditional story structure. There are so many good ones. Some by people who've actually written movies - crazy, right? Knowing how stories actually work will inspire you to sit down and start writing more than this quasi-spiritual, looney tunes, "inner movie method."

Once the author enters into the area of love of God his logic becomes glossy and fuzzy. The end of the book that deals with how to love is poor. An excellent book until the author delves into the theology of God where he relies on the theology of others. Unlike another reviewer, other than the first chapters, I do not feel this is a book for teenagers.

Let me just say it was entertaining and you have to suspend a lot of disbelief. However, what irritated me the most was "where the heck were all the photos"? Considering the amount of time Mr. Keel spent in West Virginia/Ohio area watching the skies I can not believe he NEVER took any photos. Granted a lot of time he spent watching and sighting was at night but they had film and cameras back in the early 70's that could handle night photography. There is mention of a an individual trying to do a documentary but the cameras would malfunction or the fim would not develop properly but I found this pretty lame. There are not even any photos of the town, landmarks, roads, witnesses or any physical evidence. I found this the most dissappointing of all. Photos would have made this extremely more credible book.

I, too, have Borderline Personality Disorder, and this book was a God send for me. I have been in therapy for quite a while and did not understand why I was feeling "this way or that way" and this book CLEARLY explained "why" I was having those feelings in the first place. I want to have Rachel as a friend. Her honesty literally saved me because I had so many "hidden" secrets that I dared not bring up to my therapist-nor anyone else for that matter, and couragous Rachel went there and bravely talked about those same feelings. And Dr. Padgett is "hands down!" the best therapist I have encountered to date. Too bad I only had the chance to encounter him through Rachel's book..sigh. I am very thankful for this book, and even if this book cost one hundred thousand dollars, I would recommend it to anyone with BPD and to someone who has a family member with this diagnosis. KUDOS RACHEL! I LOVE YOU! THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY! :) :) :)

Combining a staggering imagination with a powerful illustrative style, his works provoke and antagonize the viewer like no others, and demand scrutiny.This book shows the evolution of this mad genius by taking us through all of his cartoons, comics, and illustrations, (no paintings) from his first commercial drawings to recent times. It is very interesting to see these after becoming familiar with his oil paintings. The quality of the various items within varies widely, from very crude, to masterly.Some of his comics are extremely smuttty and raw, much more than most of his paintings even. But if you have a sick sense of humor, you'll appreciate them. If you're not familiar with his work, I'd recommend "Views From a Tortured Libido" or "Malicious Resplendence" as your first Robert Williams book.

But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners.

One would tend to think that, by now, every subject of intellectual or cultural appeal would have already been fully deconstructed (or otherwise posmodernized) given the academic supranimerary of English Studies faculty with nothing better to do. If I had to pick a subject obscure enough to have escaped the onslaught up till the end of last century I might have ventured: 'Pataphysics, an intellectual peral whose creation we owe to the unique and tragic genius of Alfred Jarry. But even this unlikely target seems to have now fallen under the pomo scalpel if one is to blame Christian Bok's recent "'Pataphysics: the poetics of an imaginary science".Finding himself a letter short of a book, Bok opted to write an "obfuscule", i.e., a statement to his own misaprehension and misappropriation of his subject. These start appropriately with the title. Presumably because it concerns itself with the search for imaginary solutions, 'pataphysics becomes "an imaginary science"! By the same token the Chemistry of aqueous solutions would surely become an "underwater science" or the Psychology of Serial Killers a ... "a murderous science"! In fact, 'Pataphysics is not A science, real, symbolic or imaginary much less the pseudo-science that Bok keeps harping but, as Jarry forcefully underscored, 'Pataphysics IS Science!The remainder of the book belabours the presumption that 'Pataphysics represents a stage in some secular clash between Poetry and Science (read Good vs Evil) without offering any kind of evidence for the existence of such confrontation, not to speak of why 'Pataphysics would be called into the fray! Bok regards this downturn as a remedy to the avowed disengagement of 'Pataphysics which does not apparently square with his own militant anti-science agenda. Thus he vows to outjarry Jarry by making him a born-again Nietzschiean and liberating the little Derrida inside him (as if Ubu was not enoUgh)! Though he calls his work "a survey" he is quick to veer of his purpose under the ridiculous pretext of "avoiding the normalization(?) of patahphysics" ... "by alluding intermittently to 'pataphysical enterprises' that do not refer to the tradition of Jarry but nevertheless represent some of the exceptions to the genealogy that this survey posits." And, immediately following, he takes exception to his own anti-normalizing scruple by offering a classification of the exceptions found in the lore of pataphysics --- not questioning, of course, whether once classified under his rule these remain exceptions! But even his translation of the pataphysical bon-mots betrays Bok's distorting agenda: sizygy becomes 'alliance' as opposed to the confluence it has expressed since the greeks, clinamen is 'deviance' rather than the simply 'deviation' to better echo the 'transgressive' postures that the post-modernist must fashion him self to assume. Soon enough the Deleuzian deleuzions, the Althusserian trussles, and the Baudrillardian inbroglios raise their wrongheadeness overshadowing any other pretense to "survey" Jarry or his 'pataphysical descendance. Bok gives hardly more than a page to the College de 'Pataphysique (most of it invoking Samuel Butler!), which he calls and 'absurd school' and equally short shrifts Queneau, Torma, Daumal, Arnaud, Duchamp and Shattuck (all very interesting individuals on their own.). who animated it before its self-occultation in 1972 He never mentions Vian, Satie, Salvador, Miro, Dubuffet, Ionesco, Marx (Groucho, of course), Clair or Prevert: all Satrapes of Highest Munificense in the 'Pataphysical Pantheon. He ignores the contributions of such classical american 'pataphysicians as Gelett Burgess, Walter Arenberg, Tex Avery or Frank Zappa or current ones like Bill Griffith, Peter Shickele, Mark Leyner or Karen Mantler. Instead he picks three 'case studies' of 'pataphysical influence which he insists in parochializing as Italian Futurism, French Oulipism and Canadian Jarryism. Needless to say these excursions are hampered by Bok's peculiar myopia and thus remain perfunctory and unfair to the movements and individuals he sets to describe in all respects, including their different 'pataphysical inspirations. Aware of Bok's credentials as an expert in recent Canadian literature I was hopeful of gaining some enlightenment about the late "Four Horsemen" and their intensive experiments in sound poetry, in comics and VoIdeo or the unique work of the intriguing Christopher Dewdney, to which Bok dedicated a number of articles. What Bok delivers is some unsufferably pedantic description of anecdotical exploits wrapped in some diatribe against the poetic promoters of canadian nationalism, a subject which only becomes 'pataphysical malgre' soi, much as Bok's own language does at its worst. Here is a typical gem [p.15]: "Science graphs a rhizomatic flowchart, an agonistic force field of diversified catastrophies, some which collide with each other, some which collude with each other, all of which operate together simultaneously in fits and starts as asynchronous rates of incommensurate change". The only thing conveyed by such bouts of verborrhea is that Bok takes 'pataphysics to be something like and extension of his poetic license to sokalize his mixed metaphores well beyond the merely silly into the much netherer reaches of the truly idiotic (or "ideotimistic" as he no doubt would call it)! All he manages, finally, is to become the joke he does not get. Ah Ha!For all the talk of parody and irony, the single remarkable thing about Bok's prose is how entirely destitute it remains of humour, wit and charm --- the recognizable signposts of the 'pataphysical, as of the scientific and the poetic at their very best! If is is any indication of what his poetry may be like, I am sure to never find out and that may be the one devisable merit of this essay. For anyone truly interested in 'Pataphysics I urge the Fayard 2000 edition of "Les Tres Riches Heures du College de Pataphysique" which you can get from Amazon France or, in the english speaking world, the &lt;a href="www.atlaspress.co.uk">Atlas Press publications&lt;/a> of the Institutum Pataphysicum Londoniense.

The insights and honesty with regards to the authors feelings and therapy and pain and behavior is truly a gift and a blessing. This author is very articulate and the book is a compelling read. While it can be triggering, if a person who is suffering from mental illness reads it in its entirety rather than stopping at the triggering moments, I believe it can be very helpful. It can bring up a lot of stuff though so it is good to have a great support system around if you choose to read it.Thank you "rachel" and thank you "dr. padgett" for taking this journey to wellness. And thank you "rachel" for your candor and honesty. I don't think I have ever read a book that has touched me so much and has given me such hope. It is definitely your gift to the world.UPDATE: I allowed my teen daughter to read this. She is suffering from PTSD and has borderline traits. She is psychologically sophisticated and can understand the topic. She is in therapy herself. With those things in mind, it has turned out to be a great thing for her. It has given her hope, given her courage to face her own inner demons in therapy, helped her to feel not so bad about herself for feeling the way she does, etc. So, depending on your child and your situation, and their treatment, this could be helpful to their treatment. You could always let the therapist read it to get their opinion.UPDATE 1/8/10: I have bought this for 2 of my friends and they have also both found it extremely helpful and hopeful. 1 of the friends was diagnosed with BPD and the other was dealing with general anxiety and depression. They both felt that the book gave them insight as well and an anchor to turn to when things got desperate for them--because this woman had a difficult journey and was painfully honest and came through it empowered.

Despite the price, all the datas are useful. From deep water to ocean surface circulation, from sattelite global observation to shipboard observation, you will miss no data, no equations and no methodology (that's the bestpart for my office). For people who want to work in this field of research, this book is a masterpiece. Not only for the professionnal qualities of the authors but for the synthesis of the WOCE. This book is within the reach of any person with a background in sciences. I highly recommended this book to university students in oceanology. And the structure of the contents is clear and readable. Learn the future of our planet and the CO2 poison progression.

A tenacious scribbler, he carries us on a journey back to the timeless world of nature. Quick to tell us of his passion for ferns, he recounts his journey to Oaxaca, Mexico with his collegues who share his fascination.On one level, we are treated to a kaeidoscope of hundreds of exotic ferns and their latin names he and his frends find in the lush vegetation of Mesoamerica. Not being a fern lover myself, I marvel at the intrigue of the hunt for these living fossils, objects from the distant world of time and creation before the advent of humanity. One would expect that such trivia would bore the reader, but no, Sacks absorbs us in his fascination with the varieties of these creature; he takes us along in the narrative by his marvel with discovery.At another level, Sacks enters the world of Oaxaca. He treats us to the rich culture of the region. He regails us with tales of the potato, the tomato, the bean, maise and pepper. He describes the ageless Oaxacan cuisine that nourishes his fellow pilgrims and the people of the region. The rubber ball of the Zatopec culture and the games played with it especially intrigues him. And his delightful descriptions of the delicious Oaxacan chocolate in all its forms stimulates mouthwatering longing for a taste. More importantly, he tells us of the people who lived in the region and bore the brunt of the Spanish Conquistadores. One is treated to the rich history of the Mesoamerican civilizations that rivaled Rome and Athens. Yet, Oaxaca's civiliztion achieved greatness while being innocent of the wheel, iron, compass, and alphabet. Sacks tells us of his confusion as a Westerner entering this world where his reference points create discontinuity.Sacks marvels at the breadth and scope of his companions' erudition. He tells us of their vigor and clarity of mind, some of whom are into their seventh decade. Most of all, he tells us of the comfort of being among fellow scientists and friends who enjoy each others company that is devoid of the competitiveness and the rush of living in the in the rapid paced world at home.He ends his tale by describing the idyllic surroundings of their last meal together beneath bald cypresses on the banks of a river. They were treated to estafado de pollo, a chicken stew in almond sauce and mole amarillo, with pork spiced with yerba santa and pitiona, all washed down with copious amounts of refreshing hot cinnamon-flavored Oaxacan chocolate!

To the person who said this was a &quot;terrible book&quot;, I disagree and I think you (for some reason) are extremely jealous or bitter and you keep misspelling the author's name. That's right, I think you've written several bad reviews. But for all the hate you put on this site, the more love Camika will get and she will blow up because for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When All Hell Breaks Loose was not perfect, but it sure was exciting and it kept me reading. I don't think she set black women back at all. If nothing, she finally showed that we as black women can be just as deceitful as black men. And the church issue was real too for people who think they are too holy to make mistakes. At any rate, I think if people can't give honest constructive criticism without lashing out, they need to keep their bitter word to themselves. No, they need to write a book and have Random House pick it up and see what people have to say about it.

It is not a work of fiction. It is not a traditional non-fiction book in that it cites a bunch of facts and figures from well-known sources. It is grusome in some regard. It will make you think. It may even make you cry.Now...I have seen just one bullfight in my life, and for some strange reason I had enjoyed it. I didn't understand it, but I got caught up in what was going on. I read this book because I am going to Spain and was thinking of possibly going to a bullfight and wanted to know more about it. This book has really done a lot for me - including to help change my mind!This is not a typical Hemingway book! The reader gets the feeling that Hemingway is sharing a table at a Spanish taverna, sipping wine and eating tapas, while sharing his thoughts and views on bullfighting. There are no sources. Hemingway is his own source. He outlines and describes the tragedy (as he calls it, for bullfighting is not a "sport" as Anglo-Saxon people understand the word) to those who have no understanding. At times, he does ramble. Just as some one who is truly sitting next to you talking to you would likely get off topic at times. It makes it more real. Much of the material is dated, but the book was written in 1931!However, the basic principles of bullfighting remain the same. It is a tragedy that has continued since Roman times, and with just a few changes over the centuries. Hemingway does a terrific job in helping readers from countries who do not have this tradition try to understand this play of life and death.If one is looking for a book to entertain and escape, this is not it! If one is looking to understand what bullfighting is, from some one who admired the play of tragedy, then this could be a very helpful read. But do expect this book to change you. For me, I once supported bullfighting wholeheartedly. After reading this, I find it disgraceful. Your mileage will vary. This book packs influence!

Thank you Dr. and Mrs. Wilbert for sharing your expertise and personal experience with Fattitudes! Following the process of self discovery defined by Dr. Wilbert has literally changed my life. I was at the end of my dieting rope when I joined the Fattitudes support group. I tried every fad diet, weight loss group, comercial diet center, starvation and bulemia. I measured my self worth by my body size. I had many temporary successes, but each time I regained the weight, it left me looking for the next quick fix. I felt out of control of my eating and was frustrated by my lack of will power. I grew to hate my body and myself. after a few years of doing nothing at all, I discovered the Fattitudes support group. With the help of Dr. Wilbert and fellow group members, I discovered that the war I was batteling with food actually had very little at all to do with food. I am in the process of discovering and addressing the issues which had for years led me to self defeating behaviors and attitudes. It isn't easy, it isn't fast, and my progress cannot solely be measured on a scale. I am facing my problems head on instead of medicating my heartaches with food.I highly recommend Dr. Wilbert's approach to healthy weight management. I am excited that many people with stories such as mine will find that there is hope beyond the struggle.

This book is an excellent book for people with little or no background in Neural Networks. The description and name of the book is pretty much what you'll get. The book begins by giving a background in C++, from there they build the basic objects and theory needed for neural nets in general. Then Rogers proceeds to give a quick overview of each of the four neural nets that he covers in the book, in terms of mathematical definitions of those networks. Then the next chapters are dedicated to his implementation of each one of those four networks (Adaline, Backpropagation, Self-Organizing, &amp; Binary Access Memory), including examples of how each one could be used.If you are looking on a book that goes into a large variety of neural networks, or that goes into the in-depth theory behind neural networks, then this might not be the book that you are looking for. Although Rogers gives a sufficient background and a firm basis of neural nets and C++ (you shouldn't get lost in the reading), his main purpose in the book is the actual programming implementation. The books main function (in my view), is to provide the reader with the tools on how to actually approach PROGRAMMING neural networks.My only complaint for this book was the extent of the examples that Rogers provided. The examples were limited in scope (and he mentions this) and detail. It would have been a little more helpful if more &quot;application&quot; information had been given; instead of just &quot;programming&quot; information. Still, though, the book is worth it if you want a strong basis on coding a neural network.All in all a great book, if you take into consideration the book's purpose. Rogers has a clean and clear writing style. He provides enough fundamental information throughout the book in terms of programming background and neural network background before proceeding to give the &quot;meat&quot; of the book.Christopher Sean Morrison

You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!!

We finally have a science non-fiction writer of our times, just like the 50's had Asimov, George Gamow, Clarke etc. Michio Kaku's books fall somewhere between books such as Tao of Physics and slightly drier reads such as those by Brian Greene and Hawking. There are no practical ways to imagine dimensions beyond three, but he comes up with so many fascinating analogies that you feel like you are tantalizingly close to understanding them. The thought examples of cylindrical spaces are extremely fascinating and the ramifications are so mind boggling that you can imagine twilight zones within twilight zones! Somewhere in between the book gets heavier, with mathematical descriptions of Strings and SuperStrings, but even among these pages you will find brief historical notes and anecdotes about Physicists and Mathematicians, that will lift your waning interests. But then the book emerges back into the layman's three dimensional world and the reading gets breezier with more descriptions of star life-cycles and black holes and worm holes.Overall, its a thoroughly enjoyable read for non-scientific folks and others for whom it may been a long while since they read a physics text book. I really wish such books had been available when I was in undergraduate and graduate schools. I would have probably appreciated the dry quantum physics math more.

However, the author speaks as though he is just about to commit suicide from such a lethal depression or you can imagine him weighing 650 pounds lying on a bed not being able to hardly even speak.

I specifically ordered the edition that she had when she was young. The supplier showed a picture of that edition, which by the way is the same as you have pictured in this email to me. I paid considerably more for it (twice what I've seen the newer edition advertised for) because the older edition is now out of print. The supplier stated that he had one copy of the older edition left, which was still in its original wrapping. However, when the woman received the book, it was the newer edition. She was thrilled nonetheless, and has read it, as she said, "Like a dessert you want to savor and never finish." The woman patient is very happy about the quality of the illustrations in the book, despite the fact that they are not the pictures she remembers. I never told her that the book she received is not what I thought I was purchasing. I'm happy because she's happy. But I know I paid more for a book that she never received. I feel that I've been had. I purchase very few items on line (maybe three things in my life) because I haven't trusted the sellers. My lack of trust has not improved by my experience of purchasing Egermeier's Bible Story Book through Amazon.

I could read this book several more times and still not comprehend the full import of Dewey's work. This is not merely a book about education, but rather a complete philosophy of education which, of necessity, is a philosophy of individual life in the social world. Like any good philosopher, Dewey builds his argument brick by brick, each brick resting squarely on the bricks beneath it. One cannot fully comprehend and appreciate the entire structure until one has examined each brick in the composition and the logical relationship among the bricks. By necessity, a brief review of a work such as this will leave out many bricks and breeze over the connections from brick to brick. Any inaccuracies thus resulting are my own and not Dewey's failure to construct a solid argument.To the extent this book can be summed up, the overriding theme is that much confusion and debate regarding education (and, indeed, much of life), stem from false dualisms, such as the dichotomy between thinking and doing, mind and body, individual and society. Once we recognize that those dualisms are in fact simply interacting forces which shape individual experience and development, the aims, role, materials and methods of education become almost self-evident.Dewey begins his argument with an exploration of early childhood. From earliest days, all learning is experience, and all experience is learning. The infant must learn how to control his body simply by moving his body and adjusting to the reactions and feedback thereto. Such reactions inform future movements and so on, in an on-going interchange of influences which eventually lead to the mastery of skills such as sitting up, standing and walking, which are just as much mental feats as they are physical. Similarly, speech is learned through the interaction of the infant's own natural noises and the sounds she hears in her environment, particularly the sounds reflected back to her by other people. Hence, the infant is part of a social world from day one, and, like the material world, she both shapes and is shaped by such social world.By nature, humans are endowed with interests and aptitudes which draw them to certain experiences and stimuli which, if properly guided and allowed to progress naturally, result in each individual developing and contributing in rich, organic and meaningful ways in his or her unique capacity. But because of our false dichotomy between thinking and doing, we tend to isolate education either toward focusing on tasks and occupations or toward thinking, reasoning and "cultural" pursuits. This leads to a multi-tiered society in which the majority are consigned to labor at tasks considered menial and bereft of culture, while the "superior" class of people lead an idle life - supported by the laboring class - devoted to preserving the intellectual and cultural life. But because this intellectual life is disconnected from meaningful activity, it too is dry and devoid of rich experience. Hence, the upper classes and lower classes both suffer from such divisions, even if the upper classes are not fully aware of or able to grasp the cause of their affliction.Furthermore, while this split can work in a hierarchical, feudal society, it is incompatible with the ideals of democracy, in which each individual should be contributing his or her unique talents and interests toward his or her own development and the governance and progress of the whole. In a dualistic society where the majority of individuals are cut off from a true connection with the meaning and results of their occupations, there will naturally be many who can/will not contribute and instead will be a drain.Contrary to the frequent misunderstanding of progressive educational theory, Dewey does not advocate doing away with formal instruction or letting children simply do what they like. It's not that easy. It's a matter of structuring the educational environment so that students have experiences that relate to their prior experiences and to their experiences and interests outside the classroom and which spark new interests and associations. Through rich exposure, students are guided to explore and develop meaningful understanding which preserves the connections between thinking and doing and which cuts across and integrates material from various disciplines into a holistic understanding. You can't simply stuff a bunch of disconnected facts (what we commonly view as "knowledge" - the accumulated repository of past, settled experience) into a child's head and expect it to spark interest or pursuit. Rather, you start with the pursuit of relevant experience and the facts and knowledge will follow. As students integrate their own experience, they will want to know - and be in a position to understand - other people's related experience. Without such integration, there is no framework for such "knowledge".Furthermore, you can't teach "morals" as a distinct set of facts, rules or thoughts. Doing so implies a superior class which dictates to a lower class. Such dictates and morals only "stick" to the extent they are externally enforced because they are not truly part of the individual's self. Morals, like all other knowledge, must be learned through experience in the normal social environment. Again, the social environment must be structured to lead to desired behavior and understanding through experiencing consequences in a democratic environment.Sadly, our society seems to be turning ever further away from Dewey's ideals of full individual contribution in democratic life. At younger and younger ages, we are trying to stuff students full of facts and knowledge isolated from their relevant experience so that they can regurgitate this material on standardized tests which benefit not the child, but the adults enforcing such tests. This leads to students perceiving education as largely a dry and meaningless exercise to perform for the benefit of pleasing adults rather than for any intrinsic benefit. Furthermore, morals or "character" are being drilled into students as a collection of catch phrases of the "work hard, be nice" variety. Students are expected to comply unquestioningly with almost arbitrary rules regarding the minutiae of behavior, speech and dress with little understanding of the whys and wherefores of such requirements. These students are not being raised to be independently thinking members of a democratic society, but rather a compliant workforce for the world's corporate conglomerations. Interestingly, the heads of these conglomerations and governments tend to send their own kids to progressively oriented schools based on Dewey's theories. Again, we are cultivating a ruling class atop a laboring class, which is the antithesis of democracy.One jarring aspect of Dewey's writing to modern readers may be his descriptions and understanding of "primitive" or "savage" peoples. Such thinking is a product of Dewey's time when little thought was given to the different perspectives and paradigms of indigenous peoples and how such differences mask complexities in seemingly "simple" societies. However, even in the modern world, we still seem unable to bridge cultural gaps, and we still reduce societies alien to our own to simple caricatures. Every terrorist attack or outbreak of gang violence is simply evidence that "they" don't think or care about life the way "we" do. The possibility that their "savage" behavior might have something to do with our own relationship with them rarely occurs to us.This book is one of the seminal texts of modern thought and the "American Dream". It is not only a book on education (although it is that and should be required reading for every educator), but also a treatise on the roles and responsibilities of individuals in a democratic society and how best to prepare individuals to take on those roles and responsibilities. We have steadily - and silently - been losing our democracy over the past several decades as our public interests are sold off to private, moneyed interests which have profit, rather than societal benefit, as their motive. The fabric of our shared social interests is being rent, and individuals are being set against each other in pursuit of individual interests. But, as Dewey demonstrates, there aren't really individual interests separate from social interests. We are all intrinsically and inseparably related and dependent on each other. When we destroy social interests, we destroy the protections that allow our individual interests to flourish. We must realize our fundamental relatedness before we allow ourselves to be destroyed.

I find it hard to believe that The Black Arrow is probably the least well know of his great adventure novels (the others being, of course, Treasure Island and Kidnapped), as it is certainly the best as far as I am concerned. As far as the story goes, it is one of the most entertaining plots that I have ever encountered. It is filled with more twists and turns than I would have thought possible, but remains very clear and fast paced. The characters are wonderful, as is the description and the writing itself. Granted, some of the language is a bit archaic, but I feel that this adds a lot to the authenticity of the story.The Black Arrow is not a very easy read at first, but once you get into it it really flies by. It is as entertaining, exciting, and intriguing book as you will find, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Even though I now know Struts to about the 75% level, thanks greatly to this book which helped me in the upgrade from version 1.0 to 1.1, Struts never ceases to amaze me - what it can do, the work that it can save a web programmer, its robustness and its elegance too.The down-side is of course the steep learning curve, and the sticking points that I still come across where I have programmed or configured something wrong and can't work out why. In both these areas this book is invaluable.In the first case if someone needs to learn Struts, this covers the basics and provides a good grounding, and secondly I found the contents page and the indexing always lead me straight to the point in the text where I need to be when I've just created a bug in my code or I don't know how to approach a problem.Struts in Action is well written with flowing text and clear explanations, even to the point where I sometimes find myself reading the whole chapter after looking up and finding a little snippet of info - you never know what else you might learn.

A good thing about this book is it has easy handwriting. I like this book because it had a lot of fantasy. I didn't like this book because it didn't have a lot of action. The book is about a 10 year old boy named William who had a maid named mrs. phillips that gave him a castle. One night, William went into the attic to play with the castle and opened the box that had the Silver Knight. The Silver Knight talked to him and william about his life. If you want to know more about the book than read the book.Here's somthing you could read. There is not much action until the end. There is a sequal. It could be better but I haven't read it.

I would place this book in the top ten books I've read on the conflict. As others have noted, the book covers the Luftwaffe's contributions to the Crimean battles of early 1942 and the initial success and ultimate failure of Operation Blue. From its initial explanation of the importance of oil to the German decision making process on deciding what the focus for the 1942 campaign would be, to the final failure of the greatly overtaxed Luftwaffe to provide adequate support to either 6th Army in Stalingrad or the German efforts in the Caucasus, the book added greatly to my knowledge and understanding of why things happened as they did. This book provides a unique perspective and complements the other fine works on the Eastern Front in 1942, and is not to be missed.

Bristol "bibliophile"	11	12	2005-11-08 17:18:37+08	just another kid	In this book, Torey Hayden teaches a challenging class for emotionally disturbed children consisting of Shamie, Geraldine and Shemona, three refugees from Northern Ireland, one of whom (Shemona) is an elective mute; Dirkie, who has schizophrenia; Mariana, who is sexually precocious but academically behind; and Leslie, also autistic and unable to communicate. Hayden could badly use an aide, and she accepts Leslie's mother, Ladbrooke, who is a beautiful but aloof women with a history of alcoholism and child abuse. Through their relationship, Ladbrooke comes to trust Hayden and begins to face up to her problems. Through working with the children, Ladbrooke develops considerable self-esteem. All but one of the children improve, as well, and make dramatic gains in academic and social skills. In an epilogue, we learn of updates, the most remarkable perhaps being Ladbrooke's. This is anything but a grim read, however, Hayden seasons her book with a healthy dollop of black humor.

The Triumph of the Moon, by Hutton,Hutton is a British historian who has spent 10 years or so researching pagan history. He recent book deals with the social and cultural forces that led to the emergence of Wicca in the middle of the 20th century. He then chronicles the major trends in Wicca in the last half of the 20th century. In one chapter he discusses the Starhawk/Budapest feminist California liberal misandrist turn that paganism took in the 1980s. Hutton describes how their badly misandrist and overly emotional writing lacked any scholarly credibility, but nevertheless had a major impact of Wicca and paganism in general for two decades. With publication of Hutton's book and others we are finally beginning to see some signs of returning to a more balanced pagan literature.His history is incomplete however, and he makes some of the same mistakes and assertions that he criticizes others for making. For example in the first half of the book Hutton extensively details literary references to witches and claims about historic roots. Many pages are each devoted to Margaret Murray and others. Then toward the end he waives off all of that in a page or two by simply asserting that it has been disproved. He provides nothing close to supporting data to demonstrate that claim. A few years ago I attended a workshop by Dolores Ashcroft-Nowikci (21 books and other publications listed on Amazon) where she described in detail her study of an actual pagan village that kept itself hidden since the Norman invasion, and which had written records of village life since that time. According to Nowicki the village was finally over run by urban sprawl in 1990 but most of the residents have relocated to a new hidden village that still follows pre-christian pagan traditions. Nowicki says that her mother was born in the pagan village. Either Nowicki was lying to everyone who has attended her workshops describing the pagan village, or Hutton's scholarship that "disproved" the survival of actual pagan villages is sadly lacking. I have also researched or become aware of several other pieces of information that leads me to believe 1) that some of the historical witch trials and hangings were in fact people whom modern pagans would recognize as pagan witches, and 2) that some family tradition witches were actually surviving pagan witches. Hutton asserts that all claims to any pagan survival have been disproved, and in fact are not possible, but he offers no proof and provides no data. A widely published author, Initiate Wiccan HPS, and leader of a Ceremonial Magick society in the UK such as Ashcroft-Nowicki cannot be waived off by assertion without some evidence that her claims are false. My own family admitted to being witches at the Salem trials, but their stories have been deleted from current histories rather than researched and discounted. You won't find their names on lists of witch trial victims published in the last half century. Today's historians would rather claim that all the witch trial victims were really Christians. That's not scholorship, that's just avoiding the disagreable facts.On the positive side Hutton does provide a lot of information about Gardner and subsequent Wiccan history. His observations about the state of Wicca today are interesting. I was especially fascinated by the discussion trying to fit Wicca into anyone's scholarly classification system for religions and religious branches. Wicca, it seems, doesn't fit any classification system and religious scholars don't know what even to call it. I would recommend the book to all Wiccans and interested parties, but keep in mind that it's not the last word on a lack of pagan roots.

After 8 months of following its low carbohydrate guidelines my A1C has dropped from 8.7 to an all-time low of 6.4 and my daily insulin dosage has decreased by almost 40% (both long-acting and fast-acting). I finally feel a measure of control over the disease and am slowly getting some respite from the constant frustration that unpredictable fluctuations in blood glucose measurements inevitably induce. I must add that I have not even been following the program very rigorously and have chosen to pass on some of its more drastic aspects (to me). I do admit that losing most of my carb-heavy comfort foods was difficult at first (and occasionally still is) but the payoff is really so staggering that I believe every diabetic should be exposed to this information as part of their healthcare education and shouldn't have to buy a book in order to obtain it.

He must struggle to overcome them all, if he is to set free his beloved Dejah Thoris from a nested series of &quot;Heavens within Heavens.&quot;If he wins, will he kill the &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; in the title? What will happen to religion on Mars if he does? If he loses...........An ideal introduction to science fiction and fantasy for boys reaching puberty. They can sublimate their aggressive tendencies as they imagine themselves opposing plant men, white apes and other foes.

This is a really fascinating look at the life that exists in a small suburban lawn---the many stories that play out there, with birds, squirrels, trees, grasses, even fungi! It's written in a light and very readable way, and is enjoyable from start to finish.A few things would have made this book even better in my eyes. I'd have loved a drawing or map of the yard---the author often refers to different regions of the yard, like the Bamboo Forest, and I just couldn't quite picture how the yard was set up. Also, like many people, I didn't have a good idea how big 2/10th of an acre was---It would have been great to have been given something to compare the size of the yard with. At times, also, the author is a little more cutesy that I like, with slangy names for things that seem a little forced, like she was trying too hard not to be technical.The most interesting thing I learned from this book was how huge the problem of non-native species is in this country! I remember doing a report in high school on periwinkles, which were all over the Maine coast I grew up on, and finding out they were introduced to the coast just centuries before. I checked several other sources as I just couldn't believe that to be true---there were so MANY of them! Now I realize how giant the problem is, and how MOST of the life in the author's yard is non-native. I wonder what we can do about this problem?Certainly a recommended read, especially for those who enjoy watching the birds and wildlife close to home and would like to better understand what they see!

A little short on the info, sometimes. Sometimes he'll just lightly graze a topic, and flutter on to the next piece/artist, leaving you wondering why he didn't continue in the same vein.A fun idea but not exhaustive.

He was required by the judge to turn in urine samples to make sure he wasn't still using it while on bail. The judge also told his attorney he could not tell the jury that McWilliams had AIDS and had used the marijuana to ease vomiting (he died choking on his own vomit).Read ALL his books, share them, give them as gifts.

I was surprised to learn that this story happened in the very town I had just made my home. I began asking the townspeople about the Mothman and found that no one would talk about it. When I would bring the subject up they would change the subject or act like they hadn't heard me. I was intrigued. I made a trip out to the TNT area where much of the story took place. Having traveled over much of the U.S., I can tell you that the TNT area is the most spooky place I have ever seen. I defy anyone to go there and not have the hair stand up on the back of his neck. I couldn't wait to get out of there and I've never gone back. The story is being made into a movie. I can hardly wait. BTW. I am 66 years old, not 12.

But after experimenting with various dictionaries, I find that I much prefer to keep The New World dictionary right beside me at my desk, when I'm standing at the overhead projector, when I am circulating around the room to help students. I find The New World easier to read and easier to use. For example, when looking at multiple meaning words such as plot or setting, it is easier to pick out the language arts/literary definition in The New World dictionary. It also offers more in the way of support for people learning English or Spanish -- for example the section that helps Spanish speakers understand English prefix/root/suffix is very useful to ESL students and teachers in a high school setting.

Tricia Goyer, the author, reveals many of the reasons why GenX parents react in certain ways and she offers simple ways to improve. Her advice and encouragement is always accompanied with a biblical reference to tie the author's words to the Word.The author gives lots of interesting facts about the different generations and their different characteristics. Another interesting feature is all the quotes from other GenX parents giving their point-of-view. In additon, with all the 80s music lyric references, how could the GenX member not "feel right at home?"The book is well written in simple language. It doesn't come from some "too hard to read" technical perspective, but from the perspective of a fellow struggling GenX parent. Ms. Goyer notes that she too struggles with parenting issues at times, so the reader is placed (not beneath) but right beside the author...as we all are seeking to be the parents that God wants us to be.A study guide (by chapter) is included at the end of the book for a more indepth personal look at each chapter...and each section complete with a number of biblical references for study.There's so much great information in this book!Tricia ends the book on such a positive note that you can't help but be proud to be a part of GenX and encouraged to be the best GenX parent that you can be!

His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the &quot;common good.&quot; However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand.

He notes, "It might seem that the need for protection from predators couldn't mean much when it comes to reading water and finding fish in lakes. But it becomes very important once you recall that you're the predator. You have to get past a trout's defenses before you can coax it to the fly and feel its weight dangling pleasantly in your landing net".Catching trout is tough, regardless of the circumstances. Even though they may have pea-sized brains, they're wired for survival, and the fisherman has necessarily ceded the home field advantage to the fish. But in streams, the locations where they may be lurking can be easily spotted, water depth can be discerned, and the speed of the current requires the trout to make a fast decision to bite or not to bite. Furthermore, fish "hold" in preferred locations - you can go back to them again and again.None of this applies to fishing stillwaters. Think about it; in an expansive lake or pond of uncertain depth the trout can move around at will. They can be here today, and gone tomorrow. They have all the time they want to study our carefully tied flies and detect any deficiency in form or presentation prior to pouncing. And they'll use all their innate cleverness to full advantage in their effort to foil the fisherman.Hence the need for Strategies for Stillwater.Dave Hughes, perhaps my favorite fishing author, delivers a science that sets up the challenge: intellect versus instinct. Armed with the information in this book, the angler can level the playing field in a contest that otherwise affords full advantage to the other contestant.The book opens with a discussion of trout behavior along with a study of the structure of stillwaters and the effects of plant life. From here we go on to learn about necessary gear and means of getting around lakes and ponds, and basic approaches using dry flies, nymphs, wet flies and streamers. Hughes then goes into detail on the most important food forms in lakes and how to imitate them.I still only catch one trout in a lake or pond for every ten in a stream, but without this book my average would be even worse.

The fact that Phillips was the intellectual architect of the Republican Party's "southern strategy" which allowed everything he now decries to develop only adds to its poignancy. Because Phillips attempts so much, however, he is bound to overreach. That's a fault, though, that can be easily remedied by adding a couple of excellent new volumes on kindred topics to your reading list. For a better appreciation of the deep historical background to the Iraq War, I would start with Greg Grandin's breathtaking new book about US involvement in Latin America, from the early nineteenth century forward. It's called "Empire's Workshop." Stephen Kinzer's "Overthrow" is also worthwhile, though less historically grounded.

Freud was one of the first, and one of the most brilliant, psychologists to attempt a `scientific' study of the mind. Freud attempted to explain and understand the dynamics of the psyche, not through mere casual observation or personal introspection, but through clinical experience. There are many scientists and philosophers, Karl Popper being the most famous, who have attacked Freud for being `unscientific' in method and for failing the test of falsifiability in his conclusions.It must be admitted that any attempt to study the mind using the methods of objective science is going to run into some serious epistemological hurdles; hurdles that still have not been entirely overcome to this day. These epistemological questions are important questions and should be taken seriously. But in my opinion the people who are busy picking apart Freud's theories to see whether they are `scientific', or whether they measure up to some preconceived notion of what a scientific theory should be, are asking the wrong questions. The question that should be asked is: have Freud's theories and writings increased our understanding of the nature and the dynamics of the human mind? The obvious answer to that question, in my opinion, is yes.The Interpretation of Dreams is Freud's attempt to understand the nature and dynamics of dreaming. We all take for granted the fact that we dream, but few of us ever truly begin to wonder at how strange a fact that is; and even of those of us who do only a few will go on and attempt to understand why we dream in any serious way. There were people who attempted to understand dreaming before Freud but Freud has come to tower above them in the same way that Adam Smith has come to tower above all the economists who came before him and probably for good reason.Freud puts forward some fairly counter-intuitive thesis in regard to dreaming. The first is that all dreaming is wish-fulfillment. This is the kind of claim that seems to fly in the face of empirical evidence, as well as our everyday understanding of the nature of dreams. I am not going to attempt to enter the debate in regard to whether Freud was right in this conclusion but it should be pointed out that this was a conclusion Freud was led to in his clinical experience, and the obvious objections to this theory (the existence of anxiety dreams for instance) were objections that Freud was well aware of and Freud deals with them directly in this book.The real meat of the book, in my opinion, is Freud's attempt to analyze the psychological processes that give rise to dreams. The fact that Freud begins with a counter-intuitive hypothesis, namely, that all dreams are wish-fulfillments, requires him to undertake the task of explaining how (and why) these wishes take the form of dreams as we know them. Dreams certainly do not appear to us to be wish-fulfillments. Freud has to explain why dreams do not appear on the surface to be wish-fulfillments and this requires him to work out a theory of psychic functioning which will adequately explain how dreams are formed.This ultimately is the reason why I say that Freud was one of the first to attempt a scientific study of the mind whether his theories measure up to the philosopher of science's standards or not. Freud's method is entirely different from the person who simply attempts to describe the nature of dreams by describing their pictorial form, their logical incongruities, etc. Freud puts forward an hypothesis and this hypothesis leads him to some new and startling conclusions about psychic functioning which would not be immediately obvious to a person merely engaged in casual introspection.In order to explain the form dreams take Freud first makes a distinction between the manifest and latent content of a dream. This is probably the central notion behind the whole book, and the reason, in Freud's opinion, that no one had succeeded in understanding dreams before him was because no one was able to make this distinction. Attempts to understand dreams before Freud focused all of their attention on a dream's manifest content. The latent content of a dream can only be discovered in the analytic situation by allowing the patient to free-associate in regard to different elements of the dream. Through this method one is able to discover the latent thoughts behind the creation of the dream.The dream is formed by a number of processes operating on these latent thoughts. One of the processes is condensation in which elements from the dream-thoughts are combined and condensed into a single manifest content. Another process is that of displacement in which psychic values are transferred between contents. The dream also has to deal with the problem of representability which Freud deals with extensively.There are a number of aspects of Freud's work which seem slightly primitive when reading him today. Freud was well aware that he was heading out into new territory and that many of his theories would have to be revised in the future as we learned more. But a person can still learn a great deal about the functioning of the psyche from reading this book, and not just about the formation of dreams. Freud's theory of dreams (as well as his theories on neurosis which are not dealt with directly in this book) required Freud to re-evaluate the nature of the human mind. He presents a new schematic of the mind and how it functions in the final chapter of the book. While some of this does seem slightly primitive today it cannot be denied that Freud's theories have profoundly altered our understanding of what it means to be human. No one who is interested in that question should skip this book (or Freud's other works).

In my opinion, Brunner had his best novels before this time (Zanzibar '69 and Sheep '72, for example). Original idea of stranded unprepared colonists/refugees, which allows for millions of different scenarios to play out. But the written plot feels too molded rather than loose, free-flowing. It was so written that everything was stacked-up to end up the way it did; there was no fluidity or compromise. And again (as it seems to be a key SF ingredient from the 60s-80s), I must say characterization of women through sexualization is a cheap cop out for any writer. Brunner wrote terrible one-dimensional female characters in Polymath. Thankfully, the SF ideas (mainly, the Polymath career idea) were original enough to rescue this book from a 2-star rating.

Dr. Stockmann faces an extreme moral delema. It really made you wonder; what would I do in this situation? Would you be able to trade everything (your position, money, house, and reputation) just to be able to tell the truth? Even though by not letting it out you could become very popluar. This situation is applicable to many situations in real life ranging from events happening at a high school to things in the government. Even though it was written 150 years ago, Ibsen's characters' problems are still reflected all over the world, making this play a must read for everyone.

Then I read this book of Sowell's. African Americans, including myself, have rejected Sowell out of hand because he does not line up with the orthodoxy of Dyson or the typical civil rights perspective. This is because I did not realize how thoroughly Sowell understands the issues and the philosophies behind it and the opposite views. You just do not realize his grasps on things if you go by what people say or get turned off by one of his articles in the newspaper. Not only does he understand Dyson's position, he opened my eyes to the "other side's" position in a way that made me a believer. Now I know why he says what he says in his other books and they make real sense. I am buying copies of this book for other African Americans I know and am encouraging my young adult children to read it too. If you have never read Sowell, this is the place to start.

Brosnan does mention his difficult contract negotiation, but it's not as bitter as Bouton discussing contracts. Brosnan has an elephant-like memory for conversations and the batting history of every hitter he faces. You get to see every aspect of a game, from the pitchers discussing how to pitch to a batter to who's got the best pitch to the manager's pep talks before the game. Brosnan has an excellent grasp of the language and even perplexes some of his not as scholarly teammates with some of his words. Overall, a great read from a talented pitcher and author. I look forward to reading "Pennant Race."

The book is written with a rambling style similar to the apparently mindless wandering of the author. He speculates about things that are far beyond the borders of reason into worlds as mystical as the religions of those he portrays.Spinkled among this piffle is a series of semi-sound observations...just enough to lead you to think the author has some expertise on the subject. Far from it. Each sites origin is distorted beyond any recognition by the most casual but serious archeologist. Hoax articles in papers are given equal consideration to any evidence, no matter that much of that evidence is sparse. The most perplexing mysteries are left with some speculative conjecture and absolutely no support for it. A tale told by an idiot and full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.It is all bunkum and a waste of my money.

The fascinating part of this novel is the protagonist, because he is such a mix of good and bad. He has good and even heroic impulses and acts, and bad and even evil impulses and acts. The way he manages to sabotage the good things he could get reminds me of Lily in the House of Mirth, although Henchard's sabotage is due to through bad temper and anger and insecurity, while Lily's are due to ambivalence. But the trip downward is quite similar. Basically it ends up being the story of a man's self-destruction. What a crime that Hardy's novels were unpopular when he first wrote them, and the bad reviews discouraged him from writing more! I have them all but wish there were more.

I was sorely wrong. The plot is incredibly contrived, the author (a man) presumably has a very skewed idea of what a woman's thought process might be, and what could have been a very interesting social commentary about civil war-torn Somalia fell short into platitudes and generalities. But the worst thing, by far, about Knots was the writing style. I felt like it had actually been translated into English from another language -- which is not a bad thing in itself -- but had then been scoured by someone looking to replace every other word with something from a thesaurus. The author mixed colloquial language and cliches with what he probably thought was very serious, "literary" passages -- extremely off-putting and jarring to read. The point of view of the book was also extremely distracting... second person omniscient? I felt like the whole story could have been more believable (and more of the horribly contorted and strained language contextualized) if the story had been told in the first person.In short, this is an awkward and painful book to read; the prose made me cringe at least once every 5 pages.

Kip Thorne clearly explains in 'Black Holes & Time Warps' that this is not how the laws of physics work. From the book, "Many of the things permitted by the laws of physics are so highly improbable that in practice they will never happen."

So far my husband and I have prepared two recipes; both were decent and we would make them again. The ingredients are very easy to find and are not too expensive.The recipes seem to pack a lot of nutrients, and more protein than I usually get, but they also seem like they do not have enough calories to keep a person alive... after each meal my husband is craving more food. Most "main events" have less than 200 calories per serving.Our main complaint is that these dishes are not "quick and easy." (Though the cook book didn't claim to be.) Usually we prefer dishes that can be cooked in under 30 minutes. A lot of these require 15-30 minutes of prep, and then 30-60 minutes baking/simmering. After a long day of work, we usually go for something faster, otherwise we're eating at 10pm. I've come across a couple that are faster, so they may be our repeat dishes.Overall, I like it.

Always well-researched, this time the book causes Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Marino and of course, FBI Agent Benton Wesley to investigate the death of a frozen naked woman propped openly in Central Park. Their path leads them to the parents of a psychotic serial killer, one of whom can see nothing wrong about her son and the other parent who would only see his if pointing a shotgun at the son's face. The woman's identity is a shock, as is Scarpetta's handiness with a side-arm. A must-read!

What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book.

The Mothman phemomena is one that remains a mystery. Something bizarre happened in West Virginia, and it wasn't the first time. The Flatwoods Monster is another puzzling incident that happened several years before. And across the Atlanctic, not too many years after Mothman, England gave us "Owlman." What are the connections between these, and other "high strangeness" encounters? What WAS Mothman? It is a mystery that needs to be remembered, and explored. Keel does that. This book belongs on everyone's shelf -- anyone who is interested in the paranormal.Hopefully the new edition of this title will include sources, index and the like.

I had forgotten how many great players came from, or passed through, KC. The names are all familiar, but I now have a better understanding of how the names fit in the development of KC jazz. Personally, I appreciated the pages dedicated to the history of KC and the information that explains how and why the town was "wide open." Had the city not been this way early on, the music scene certainly would have turned out different. I also like the inclusion (p. 201) of early Down Beat writer Dave Dexter's explanation on how KC style jazz (or Southwester jazz) was different than New Orleans and Chicago jazz. Several years ago I got to visit the American Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball Museums in the 18th and Vine neighborhood; I wish I had read this book before I made the visit. I feel a road trip coming on . . . "I'm going to Kansas City. Kansas City hear I come . . ."

But by the time they're six years old, we've convinced them that being &quot;a man&quot; means being strong, silent, and &quot;strong&quot; -- -- and that feelings are for girls. The authors make a strong case that genes, hormones and brain development count for less in a boy's development than emotional education. Boys CAN be as empathetic, compassionate and expressive as girls -- if we give them the tools, and if we (fathers) give them models of emotionally whole men. After you read this book, you'll never see boys the same way. This book is a real eye and heart-opener. A must-read!

Since I have suffered from neck pain (not severe, but real) for about 15 years, I figured I might as well give it a try. I found that results were immediate. I was also shocked by having to confront how bad my habitual posture was.I have been doing the basic one-minute routine for about eight months now. My neck pain (and tension -- I used to have two bands of muscle of almost wooden hardness running down the back "corners" of my neck) is reduced about 80-90%, and I continue to improve. I also look taller and slimmer, as promised (my parents both said to me, "you're so tall!" as if it were a new thing -- but then I suppose it was). I would agree that you will look an inch or two taller and ten pounds slimmer. Maybe more. Now, since then I've also *gained* about ten pounds...but that's another story.

David Fay is the main character in this book and he is the person in charge of all the opens. In this book OPEN By: John Feinstein it tells how David Fay's Dream came true. He's dream was to make Bethpage Black an open. This dream came to him in 1995 and in 2002 it came true, with the help of many others like Craig Currier (superintendent) Mary Lopuszynski (sales) and many other important characters. David Fay is about to figure out all these problems because there is nothing that will get in his way of making Bethpage an open. So don't you think he will follow through? Well find out.This book is non-fiction and reads very smooth. John Feinstein did a good job of using very specific details so pay close attention. This book does not only teach you about golf it teaches you good life lessons that are unforgettable. I think this book is best suited for sports readers who want a good book to read and they will not put it down. The good thing about this book is that it makes you pay attention the bad thing is that it jumps around a little bit. The life skills this book will teach you really helped my out look on life being under thirteen and this book really deserves a try. So read it and post your own review and I think that review will be a positive one.

Strickler	1	3	2011-11-03 12:20:27+08	Insightful and compelling	I lived in Japan for eight years with the millennium right in the middle and while it is true that Feiler describes a situation that has changed quite a lot, there is much more in the book that is still relevant and truthful. I find it kind of funny that a number of readers think Feiler is arrogant or that he has a superiority complex. I found just the opposite: he is very able to laugh at himself and the crazy situations that all foreigners find themselves in in new cultures, but he is also honest enough to share his nicknames and frustrated feelings that are a natural part of the first year in a new place. I also think his great appreciation for Japan shines through his narrative - he doesn't claim to be an expert; he claims to be an observer, and for someone who stayed for a year, I think he observed a great deal.I loved living in Japan very much. I encountered both the "Can you use chopsticks?" types of askers and other very engaging, eclectic and unique people, and I think Japan, like any culture, presents the usual share of close-minded and open-minded people. Feiler both loves and hates various aspects of life there, which -- and this is the final truth of living abroad -- is what happens to us when we are at home. After a period of time, we are able to see the individuals as Selves and not just as Cultural Others. He says this when he is saying good-bye to his junior high students: he tells of visiting a doll store, where he first thought the dolls all looked the same, but as he watched the artist work with them, he began to see the differences. He says that this is what he began to realize about them as students, and he asks them also to realize this about other foreign teachers who come to teach them in future years.For those who find the book boring or lacking feeling, let me tell you a story from Japan and you can judge. I had a very good friend in Japan and when we went to say good-bye after eight years, we were both crying in the train station as we bowed and said good-bye. We didn't hug and we didn't go on and on about how much we valued our friendship. But if you think there was no feeling, read more about "soto-mae" and "tata-mae". And read this book more carefully.

In the an attempt to pay tribute to the brilliance of this (rather dense, historical & philosophical ) book, I'll try to correct this.This book presents two visions of the world. However, contrary to most of the reviewers, the difference is not about Liberals vs. Conservatives. It is about the difference between two visions of the world, and each of the visions is found in most parties in the political spectrum.The two visions are metaphysical, pre-scientific points of view regarding how the world works. In one view (Unconstrained), people can drive change, intentions matter, and this could improve the world. In the other view (Constrained), people will always be (somewhat) bad, only results and processes matter, and improvements always involve tradeoffs.Sowell first acknowledges that no vision is purely Constrained or Unconstrained. And then he explicitly does not connect the dots to (modern, US) liberal vs. conservative visions. And he doesn't do so for the basic reason that it really isn't that simple.Instead of attempting to place "Conservative" vs. "Liberal" positions on top of Sowell's 2 visions, let us look instead at every issue, and determine whether our own individual intuitions are that (a) it is a problem, and that (b) human beings can solve or meliorate, via coordinated political action, this paricular problem without creating other (potentially worse) problems. This is the issue. And the arguments for or against most actions can come from both positions.Examples from the War in Iraq.Against (Constrained): The military cannot solve a complex social problem.Against (Unconstrained): War is evil. Don't start one.For (Constrained): There will be horrible tradeoffs, but war is better than the (worse) other options of not warring.For (Unconstrained): Saddam is a blight upon Iraq, they will be better without him.I have attempted to point out that not all conservative positions are constrained, and not all liberal positions are unconstrained. Rather, different people have different understandings of the world, and these often lead to different conclusions. Using Sowell's brilliant dichotomy, people may improve their understanding of the issues facing the world, though hopefully not replace entirely any other charitable understandings.

His publications speak for themselves. However, as represented in this set of lecture notes, I do not find him as a pedagogue more enlightening than others. I bought and read this book in grad school, and found it to be a nice quick intro to several topics (spin waves and such). I did not, and still don't find the exposition physically exceptionally profound. One difference though, is the fact that Feynman, with his fame, could afford to be rather informal in his presentation. Any unsatisfactory aspects would be accepted as the mysterious ways of a 'genius'. If you are a student and would like to learn to solve problems on your own, forget this one. What this book gives you is a little 'attitude', aside from a quick intro, which most of us haven't earned the right to put on, of doing physics. Try it. Try to be as unorthodox and informal as he was, and you will mostly end up with nonsense.

Those people already familiar with Buddhism and Star Wars will feel Bortolin's argument and analogies click into place, for the most part. Those familiar with Star Wars, but not Buddhism, may not exactly realize where the Star Wars ideas leave off and the Buddhism picks up. Though some of his arguments and characterizations may seem flawed, overall Bortolin does a convincing jobs of showing the connections between the dharma or discipline of Buddhism, and the religious philosophy of the Jedi knights. Since it is very readable, and fairly informative, I guess I will lump it towards the 4 star category.

This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire &amp; world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be &quot;Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion&quot;, only recently published.

This book details deaths in the park, from accidents in hot water to falls from thousands of feet. This book will definitely inhance your awareness of danger and pleasure in the park. Will keep you on the edge of your seat, and scare you to death at the same time. Very well written, and also documented with sources for further information. A must have for anyone who has ever been to Yellowstone!

First, Sowell in this book promises to construct and teach to the reader a simple mental device that allows the reader to reduce a vast, nuanced, complex world of ideas to a single, binary heuristic device that is simple enough that a precocious 12 year old could learn it. This is the academic political theory equivalent of watching Sean Hannity or Glenn Beck on television. This is a book about how to learn to see the world in black and white, us and them, liberal and conservative, utopian and tragic. It gives the reader a set of simple tools that are powerful in that they can be applied to most of history and political and social theory. It is a reductionist dualism that is at the heart of contemporary Republican politics in the United States of America and that defines the zeitgeist of the post-1994 Republican Party in American politics. If you like your political theory sophisticated and intelligent, you will be disappointed in this. But if you want to learn tricks for winning shouting matches defending Republican talking points on blogs and internet political message boards, this book will be a powerful tool in your belt.

I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there.

What he identified as the deficits of the new social capitalism as a result of the upheavals to the old bureaucratic order of labor is disquieting and makes one wonder how we might possibly ameliorate if not counter it. His suggests this at the end of the book in pointing to 3 social developments that aim to re-foster a sense of life narrative, social community (through unions that act as job matchers and social community, and job sharing schemes) and personal agency in planning one's life (through some form of personal allocation of funds by the state).Elsewhere, his diagnosis of the inherently agitating, dynamic and shifting new economic order based on the ownership of shareholders seeking short-term gains and implicitly heralding the virtues of constant change, organizational reengineering and creative destruction over stability and long-term value building might bear challenging in some respects. While there is truth in his statement at the time of the book's publication, the ensuing global economic downturn has hearkened a return to the perceived desirability of stability and stolidity in corporations as investors seek shelter from the economic mayhem.I also questioned his portrayal of the superficially engaged and ever change-responsive ideal employee bearing 'potential' over experience, the suggestion of which is that the new economy no longer affords the accumulation and deepening of experience or development of a spirit of craftsmanship. While this might be true to some degree for some and especially junior employees, experience can be built upon even through non-consecutive or short-term projects and job assignments; experience and craftsmanship is not necessarily as narrow or constricted as he'd suggest, as in a formal capacity calling for a multifaceted awareness and approach such as general or human resource management. That said, I agree with his broad thesis that that is how society is tending to shape our valuation of experience.He makes interesting correlations between the effects of the new economy and broader social and psychological implications of our attitudes to politics and consumer consumption in the form of a kind of surrendering of the person to a surfeit of information and promise of potential. The thrall we fall under to marketing and packaging of the slick young politician over the seasoned war-weary statesman finds parallels in our consumer society's obsession with possession of the new, the gold-plated surficial differences between brands.Despite my mild reservations above, Sennett here (as in his other works on class and the accordance of social respect) offers richly leavened material for consideration. His invitation to reflection on the kind of society we were emerging into remains relevant even almost 10 years on.

As retold in Robert Creamer's 1974 biography, when asked the secret of why he hit so many home runs, he replied: "Just swinging." Asked about "the psychology of the home run" by the same reporter, Babe responded: "Say, are you kidding me?"Creamer seems to feel the same way. He's not the prose version of Jack Webb exactly, but his "Babe" is heavy on facts and remarkably light on the sort of thing modern sports writers like to fill their weighty tomes up with, cultural impact and inner-self profiling. Creamer presents teasing glimpses of Babe's revelries, and some hints of who he really was beneath the legend (one close friend says "I don't think he really loved anybody"). But his focus is on Babe the baseball player, his statistical brilliance and his awesome, game-breaking power.He broke into the majors as a pitcher, developing into "the best lefthander in the game" before it became clear, in this blessed time before the advent of the designated hitter, that he could do more to win games with his bat than his arm. What followed transformed baseball from a slightly noisier and faster version of cricket into the National Pastime. Babe Ruth didn't invent the home run, but he might as well have deserved the copyright, hitting 54 homers in 1920, more than any other entire team produced except for his Yankees, red-haired stepchildren to the fabled New York Giants until Babe arrived and changed everything.Even though his career home-run record was in the process of being broken when "Babe" was published, Ruth was about so much more than that. Creamer gets at a lot of the on-field stuff, especially, like the fact he once led the American League in batting average and, as a pitcher, produced the longest stretch of earned-run-free innings for more than 40 years.The book does come across as dry at points, though, focusing on Ruth's more measurable accomplishments and ignoring the less tangible stuff. Creamer doesn't overwhelm you with a lot of flowing prose, which is a good thing, but he leaves a lot of things alone that seem fertile ground for exploration. Possibly because the last bio I read was Robert Caro's "Path To Power," it felt like Creamer was light on sourcing, but that's probably because his method of research was a lot less formal, chats at the bar with old-timers over the course of decades condensed into the iceberg we get here.What Creamer wrote, he got right, though, something I know as a fact. My grandfather covered the Yankees and was Babe's favorite ghostwriter, and my father, who saw Babe in the Yankee clubhouse, swore by Creamer as one of sportwriting's best for giving the honest, unvarnished truth. It's not a book for boys, as Creamer notes, but "Babe" will make you feel like one reading about this real-life giant who walked the earth.

(2) The details are all included, so you will not find something like "it easily follows from..". (3)It introduces everything in a good order. For example, it treats non-relativistic Schrodinger field first before going to the relativistic theories. It has shown that non-relativistic fields permit both boson and fermion rules. From this you can easily see how quantization rules are related to relativity. I am sure you can learn some solid QFT from this book. Of course, I recommend this book along with the standard reference by Peskin-Schroeder, and the lively book by Zee.

Triumph of the Moon by Ronald Hutton to my mind is an essential read for any practicing wiccan or witch. It's a historical book of two halves. The first half is an exploration & history of the facets that make up modern pagan witchcraft, such as the Goddess, the God, cunning folk, high ritual magic, secret societies, paganism etc, then the second half is an account of how the different strands came together. It's the first proper scholarly investigation by a respected historian, and helps avoid the pitfalls of false histories etc.It can also be used as a springboard by reading the works cited in each part so as to further an understanding of the Craft. For example, I'm currently reading Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, which is the book that Francis Barret ...create The Magus (which I have already read), and these together with Crowley's Magick (Book 4 & Magick in Theory and Practice, which is also well worth reading!) give a good basis for understanding the symbolism & reasons for certain ritual practice. By understanding the philosophy it also helps to create more effective ritual oneself (although I'm more spontaneous than planned ritual in general), and helps an understanding of the occult/esoteric/hidden laws of nature.I particularly agree with his comments that when Wicca was shown to be a modern development most people started to jump to "Traditional Witchcraft" etc, claiming it to be older in provinence, when it is blatantly obvious to anyone who has looked at the evidence that it has just as few roots in the past as Wicca.Triumph of the Moon, although historical in tone, is still sympathetic to Witchcraft & its practitioners, pointing out that it is a valid independent religion (and discussing why), not a cult, sect etc, that its modern origin makes it no less valid, & doesn't attempt to discuss whether spells, healing etc really work, only that people use it & there are cases in which the intended result seems to have occured.After reading it, although the romantic notion of an age old religion will be shown to be a fantasy (which deep down most people already suspected), and that it is a modern synthesis of older & new ideas, I for one found myself feeling better than ever about being a witch.

Paul Berman's "Terror and Liberalism" is an excellent attempt at finding common ground between America's political Left and Right, at least when it comes to the current "War on Terror." Berman painstakingly shows Islamic fundamentalism for what it is, a mass political movement, actually the combining of two mass political movements - pan-Arabism (ie. the Baath party) and pan-Islamacism (ie. al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad) that are both devoted to violence and diametrically opposed to the Western Liberal tradition.Berman also argues that the Left in America has as much at stake in the "War on Terror" as do those on the Right.Paul Berman's historical research is excellent, following the path of the modern pan-Islamic movement to its roots with Sayyid Qutb (ku-tab) author of "In the Shade of the Qur'an," "Social Justice in Islam" and other works. Qutb attended the Colorado State College of Education in the late 1940's and earned a Masters Degree, but came away thoroughly disgusted with what he saw as "the barbarous West." He was especially disgusted by what the West hailed as "the emancipation of women" and "sexual liberation."At the same time that pan-Islamacism was growing, pan-Arabism was coming into political prominence behind such figures as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Though the differences between the two camps were subtle - pan-Arabists wanted a return of the old Ottoman Empire, while pan-Islamacists envisioned a world under shariah (the legal code of Islam) - they were also volatile. Berman describes the differences between the two groups as akin to the differences between the Italian fascists under Mussolini who sought to rebuild the Roman Empire and the German Nazis who sought a return to the Roman Empire in a Germanic form. Indeed the Arab world sided with the Axis powers during World War II, which led to England and the U.S. setting up the state of Israel in what was then the Palestine territories.In 1966 shortly after Colonel Nasser took power in Egypt, several attempts were made on his life. He blamed them on his alienating Qutb's group, the Islamic Brotherhood and had Sayyid Qutb hung in retribution. Still, despite their differences, the two factions have been bound by a hatred of Israel and the West that ignites their common passions.After delving into the history of pan-Arabism and pan-Islam, Berman takes on what he sees as a misguided view among many Western Leftists like Noam Chomsky, who've rationalized terrorism as the only possible response to Western oppression by less technologically advanced nations. People like Ramsey Clark and Noam Chomsky have defined Islamic fundamentalist terrorism as an appropriate response by a smaller opponent to a bully, while Berman sees it as a cataclysmic struggle between two conflicting ideologies, one rooted in individual liberty, the separation of Church and State, a love of technology and women's suffrage and the other one diametrically opposed to all of these things on virtually every level."Terror and Liberalism" is an excellent book that not only gives the reader a broader understanding of the roots of fundamentalist Islam, but an insight into why so many on the American Left reflexively support any movement willing to take on the bully they see as America's "Military-Industrial Complex," and why that view is not only wrong-headed, but dangerous as well.

I am a type I diabetic and have been for 15 years. My wife (many thanks to her) found this book for me and since I've read it and started following the diet and exercise (primarily diet) regimen my blood sugars are near normal. Routinely, my blood sugars would elevate over 300 mg/dl after eating carbohydrates, which the America Diabetes Association recommends as 60% of your diet. Subsequent to reading this book, I've cut my carb intake to, as he prescribes, 6 mg in the morning and 12 mg at lunch and at dinner. By doing this I have been able to completely stabalize my blood sugars day and night. With my blood meter I can see what my average blood sugars have been over the past couple of months. Before I started my average was around 240 mg/dl...not too good. But, within 4 weeks of following this diet I was able to drop my average to 174 mg/dl. And, this is still falling toward 100 mg/dl where my blood sugars reside most of the time. I do crave carbs sometimes but the benefits definitely outweigh the short term cravings. Where I thought I was destined to die an early and not so happy death from complications with diabetes, I now am lifted by the hope and knowledge that I can live well into my 90's by following this simple plan. Thank you Dr. Bernstein, I owe you my life.

Find out what kind of accidents really happento cyclists, so you can learn how to avoid that sort ofaccident, and stop worrying about accidents that almostnever happen. (Like being hit from behind.)Forester is one of the world's foremost experts in trafficcycling, and he designed the *Effective Cycling* programwhich is taught by the League of American Bicyclists. Asimilar program is the Can-Bike Skills program of theCanadian Cycling Association. Both courses teach trafficcycling skills and use *Effective Cycling* as the text.I consider the &quot;riding in traffic&quot; chapters to be mostimportant. You'll learn where to be on the road (which lane?how far from the curb?) and where to be within your lane (right?middle? left?) - all of which depends on what sort of roadyou're riding on. You'll learn how to change lanes properlyin any traffic condition, how to gain cooperation from motorists,how to prevent acccidents from happening to you, and how toavoid an accident that's coming your way by using emergencymaneuvers.If you are going to buy only one cycling book, *EffectiveCycling* should certainly be the one. While you're at it,buy a gift copy for every cyclist you love.Forester's *Effective Cycling* techniques work. I ride inbusy city traffic every day and it's easy and fun.This I owe in large part to *Effective Cycling*.

I had been playing for a few months, and my confidence was brimming over along with my credit card balance.Alas, this is a great songbook, but not necessarily for beginners. There needs to be a fair amount of dexterity with playing melody chords and reading difficult key changes. I was able to simplify a number of the pieces by mentally excluding some of the harder harmonies, but it's still hard going for a newbie.I would recommend this as a fantastic collection of French music that, if played well, will recreate the sound of sitting in a Parisian cafe on a summer's day. I would also recommend getting about a year of training and practice (perhaps using some lower level Mel Bay books I have reviewed earlier) before taking on this collection.

In fact it would be my favorite book if I hadn't read The Battle For the Castle which is the next book in this minne seris. What I'm trying to say is that this is a really good book and if your only aloud to buy one book this year make it The Battle For the Castle.

It starts by me showering him with gift and attention, he doesnt appreciate it, I get hurt and nag, he runs away, I nag cause he's running away, he runs away even more. It's REALLLLLYY frustrating when all we girls ever want to do is just show our guys how much we love them and then expect that they reciprocate or at LEAST show they appreciate our effort. I have just read the book and havent applied any of the techniques as of yet but I will very shortly. I have a huge feeling it will work considering every time I give up on naging my bf and leave him alone he comes running back lol.I gave up A LOT of time with my friends because he would wine about hanging out. But whenever it came down to HIM giving up quality time with HIS friend, HECK no that would neverrrr happen. This book really helps me see that I shouldnt be so weak and just drop all my plans because my bf asks me to hang out at the last minute. It's not healthy for girls to do this but unfotunately it happens ALL the time.I've read that some of the reviews say that it didnt really work (or wouldnt work) because it made the guy give up the chase quickly cause she may have seemed to be too aloof or playing a game. From this I would recommend that people dont take the advice of this book TOO far. For example, u should show the guy that u care about him but NOT more than what he is showing u. It's not like u have to be totally aloof and pretend that he means nothing to u and act like u could do better. No. Act like u like him like he likes u but dont have a meltdown and freak attack when he starts acting distant or taking u for granted. Instead just ease down on doing the stuff u feel he is taking granted of and back off. Dont yell at him if he cancels plans. Just say something like "that's ok baby we can hang out another day. I really needed some time to get my work done anyway." Or wtvr else. And then occasionaly understand that U should break plans as well if ever the occasion comes. Dont try and bend over backwards to see him if he doesnt do the same for u.This book shows u that it's not that ur bf doesnt love u, it's just that he's different from u. He needs different things in a relationship than u do. And it's best to read this book in order to understand their perspective and not feel so bad about urself if things arent going great at the moment in ur relationship. This happens to sooooo many people and I feel this book explains it perfectly on how to react to certain situations in a relationship when ur inner needyness of a girl is dying to pop up. Keep this book at close hand!

It sounded like the 1950's or 60's but I was surprised to see the book was published in 1980. I hope things have improved since then but I think her observation that women will continue to be subjugated by men as long as they do not have any valid means of supporting themselves is fairly true. It was a bit of a surprise to read her theory linking the evils of Capitalism and women's issues- freeing women from unpaid labour in the house to being used as a cheap sources of Labour.

I had never even heard of this book but bought it at a book sale because it was Scribener's Library edition. There is a purpose for a man's (or woman's life) - to go out and change the world - to find the problems and leave the world better than before. To change one life at a time. How do you teach the children today that they need to wake up to their duty? This man was slaying giants at an early age. Let us teach our children to break out of their Wii cocoons and challenge the world order. Who knows what problems they will solve.

Stupidity and Tears by Herbert Kohl is a wonderfully written book about teaching, learning, and the educational system in the U.S. The book is philosophical, historical, and political, and the author draws from his forty-five years of experience in the classroom to illustrate many of his assertions. Kohl is an iconoclast and it strongly shines through in his critiques of the educational system and his challenges to traditional theories of how children learn and ought to be taught. However, the book is not just a searing critique, it is a call for teachers to be strong in their convictions and not let the way of the system bring them down and burn them out, as is what happens all too often.The title of the book mainly refers to the first chapter, the strongest chapter in my opinion, which is where the critique of the system is laid out. He asserts that teachers and the educational system are stupid. He does not mean to say that teachers are inherently stupid, but rather, they are stupid as a result of "institutional and social coercion" (23). He also believes that the stupidity trickles down to students, and he helps illustrate the point through a quote by a high school student: "I'd rather be defiant and stupid in class than let the teacher call me a failure" (22). The strategy of this student, compelling his teachers to focus on his negative behavior rather than his learning, resulted in feelings of being trapped and neglected by a system that could not help him learn, which he really wanted to do. The author gives many more examples of how the system is broken and paints an ominous picture of the state of education.The author also gives a passionate critique of research and generalization, particularly generalization of the development of morals in children. He states that all too often researchers make claims that their research generalizes to all children everywhere, even though they may have had a small, selective, sample. He also claims that researchers don't do enough to address many of the social aspects (e.g., culture, religion) that surely play an important role. He poses a great number of intriguing questions regarding morals of children that he believes are not presently known, such as, "What is the effect of conventional moral values on an oppressed group within a society?" (64).The author ties moral development in with imagination, and believes that teachers should nurture and allow for the imaginations of students to develop naturally at all costs. He believes that imagination is crucial to morals, and says of the imagination: It does not speak the truth, but allows people to play with possible truths, to transcend everyday reality and, through thought and feeling merged, begin to define and understand their own values. He ends the chapter with a poem likely written by a student shortly before he committed suicide - and concludes that the student likely committed suicide as a result of being alienated at school, forced to conform, void of dreams.The book brings up many great points and has certainly inspired me and reaffirmed many of my beliefs surrounding education. Kohl is not only a great resource on topics of education, including great tips for teaching, but a joy to read. I look forward to reading other works by Kohl.

Pira	0	0	2000-05-02 22:17:28+08	Long enough for a bible, but not quite good enough	This book tends to read at times as though it were longing to be classified as a science text. This is not necessarily bad. I found it very interesting to read about what makes a good pie crust: a low protein flour for tenderness, the proper fat blending technique to ensure flakiness, adequate chilling to ensure minimal distortion during baking, etc. She is very thorough and covers EVERY aspect of making pies and pastry. However, the results and the experience of using this book in the kitchen don't quite live up to the anticipation.While the fillings are generally about as delicious as they come, there are a few serious errors (I was very careful about measuring and using an accurate thermometer, and the Lemon Merangue Pie still came out like Lemon soup, twice), and the techniques required to acheive these results can be VERY time consuming. If I'm going to spend this kind of time, the recipe better be accurate. In a similar vein, the recipes for sauces, ice creams, and danish produce wonderful results. But again, do not underestimate the amount of time involved in producing them.The verdict on Rose's pie crust is more problematic. Have you ever tried kneading and pounding pie crust in a ziploc bag? Try it and watch everything stick to the inside; I don't care how cold she says it should be. It sticks and is a mess. Also, she seems to be striving for the ultimate in tenderness for her pie crusts. But using a combination of soft pastry flour, plus vinegar, plus baking soda, plus a two step blending technique (a technique which, minus the ziploc bag, can be very good) results in a crust that is, in my opinion, too tender. It loses some of the crispness that makes that makes pies, especially fruit pies, so wonderful. Also, watch out for that blending technique. If you pound a portion of the butter into the dough with a rolling pin like she says, unless you know what finished dough should look like, the butter pieces may very likely remain too large and will result in them separating out and melting during baking. Another disaster; trust me, it happened.This is a good effort, but is only for someone who loves pies and pastry and already has a good knowledge of baking which will enable them to slightly modify certain problematic techniques and recipes.

This semi-diary format book about a soldier's year in Iraq provides an insight into what the average front line infantry goes through. It doesn't cover the big picture. It doesn't cover the issues that the news media talks about. It's what the rifle carrying soldier sees, does, thinks as he goes through is deployment.His story sounds a lot like stories of other veterans. In fact I remember a book by a fellow named McBride from World War I. 'I didn't mind the war, but I hated the hell out of the Army.'The book is a good mix of stories of the day to day life, going out into bad guy country, and the view from life at the bottom of the Army. I can certainly say that life in the Army hasn't changed much from my time in it (which was from before the author was born.The web site contains a large collection of pictures.Well written, very interesting. I'm not so sure what it all means, it's just part of a life of a soldier.

I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective.

Mark Waid has again crafted a masterpiece that is not only a treat to read, but Lienil Yu's art is visually exceptional also. I have heard that some people bash his artwork, and for the love of all that is holy, I can't understand why. "Superman Birthright" is a fresh re-telling of the origins of one of earths greatest heroes.
